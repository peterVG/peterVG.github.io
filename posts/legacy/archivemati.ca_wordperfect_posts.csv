I am pursuing my doctorate research at UvA as an external candidate (‘buitenpromovendus’) which is defined by the UvA Guide for PhD Researchers (April 2003) as a ‘PhD student not employed by the university and who is working on a doctoral thesis without the involvement of a faculty but with a professor as thesis supervisor.’


We will be following a ‘sandwich model’ which, according to the UvA Information For Foreign Candidates (February 2000), ‘means that a large part of the research is carried out in the candidate’s homeland and supervision is exercised across the distance.’

I am a Canadian citizen and resident of New Westminster, British Columbia (near Vancouver) but I was born in The Netherlands and still hold Dutch citizenship. From Canada I will be in regular contact with my supervisors via email, telephone and online collaboration tools. I will also meet in person with my supervisors in the Netherlands at regular intervals to review the status of my research and to make any necessary adjustments to the research plan.

Although the abstract will be in Dutch, the language of my final PhD thesis and the working language of my research will be English.

"9","2","2005-10-27 21:39:49","2005-10-28 04:39:49","The theoretical framework for my research is Archival Science which “studies the characteristics of records in their social and cultural contexts and how they are created, used, selected and transferred through time.” (1)<!--more-->

Artefacts are products of human activity. This can include buildings, pottery shards and other types of functional objects. However, ‘Records’, ‘archives’ or ‘archival materials’ are artefacts in a documentary form. Their primary function is to store information and communicate messages by recording them on some viable medium, whether that is a drawing on a cave wall or a blog posting that is stored on a magnetic disk drive.

Archival Science studies records as process-bound information that is generated in the course of carrying out specific types of inter-connected human activities, whether in a formal business environment or within a personal sphere. Records are captured and stored with the intention of accessing them again at some future date and location whether for emotional reasons, as a memory-aid, as a source of knowledge, as legal evidence, to fulfill a specific business responsibility or to meet general social expectations of accountability. (2)

In short, records or archival materials “function as the memory of individuals, of organisations and of society. Individuals keep records in order to remember, to remind and to be reminded. An organisation needs a corporate memory to allow the organisation to keep running, to be able to make itself accountable and to document its own history.” (3)

The study of records as process-bound information that is managed as memory and evidence distinguishes Archival Science from other types of information sciences.

<h3>Phase 1</h3>
The first phase of the research is the statement of a topic of interest, establishing the research methodology, completing the University of Amsterdam administrative requirements and defining some initial, general hypotheses:

<h4>Initial, General Hypotheses</h4>
<ol style=""list-style-type:upper-roman""><li>The accessibility, relevance and usability of archival records managed by institutional memory organizations can be improved through:
<ol style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha""><li>the adaptation of new information and communication technologies and online practices from other types of Internet-based systems and communities into online archives access systems.</li>
<li>the integration of Archives user study findings directly into the functional requirements and architectures of online access systems.</li>

<li>the development of a generic, logical architecture for online archives access systems that is based on both open technology standards and archival standards and best practices.</li></ol></li>


<p>
<li>The management of personal and family archival collections can be improved by adapting generic, logical architectures for archives management systems used by institutional memory organizations to the consumer-grade products and services used at home by private individuals.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>By using common logical architectures with open standards and protocols, the online access systems of public archival collections can be integrated and synchronized with personal and family archival collections.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>By integrating archival content from institutional online access systems with archival content stored in personal and family archival collections:
<ol style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha""><li>collective memories will be enhanced</li>

<li>new communities of memory will be created</li>
<li>the value and meaning of archival materials will change</li></ol></li></p></ol>

<h3>Phase 2</h3>
The second phase of the research includes a literature and technology review that establishes a more detailed definition of the research topic, the theoretical framework, and the variables that will affect the analysis and interpretation of the research problem.

The second phase will refine the initial, general hypotheses to establish specific operational hypotheses that may be tested in the next phase of research.

<h3>Phase 3</h3>
The third phase of research will generate and collect data using both quantitative and qualitative methods.

The primary quantitative method in this research will be systems development which is a problem-solving method, typically applied to the development of computer information systems, that breaks a complex problem into pieces, designs a solution for each piece, and then integrates the solutions into a complete, operational system.

There are many system development methodologies (e.g. Structured Analysis and Design, Rational Unified Process, etc.) but, generally, each of these consists of the following high-level processes: requirements analysis, architecture design, system development and integration, system testing, system deployment, and system maintenance.

As a research method, “the systems development approach denotes a way to perform research through exploration and integration of available technologies to produce an artefact, system or system prototype. System development focuses on the theory testing, more than theory building aspects of research, allowing a smooth progression from development to evaluation. It could be thought of as proof-by-demonstration…A systems development methodology comprises three major steps: concept development; system building; and system evaluation. The concept building stage involves some theory building, where the theory can be illustrated by a system.” (1)

The systems development methodology can be used to design and implement prototype systems of both institutional online access systems, personal and family archives management systems, and any systems that are used to integrate these two. Test cases can be designed to prove empirically whether the functional requirements are met in a given system prototype.

At the same time, qualitative methods such as surveys, focus groups or interviews will have to be used to determine the level of quality improvement, if any, is deemed to have occurred for the online access systems and personal archives management technologies that are prototyped.

For the fourth and final research domain, some ethnographic research methods might be required to interpret whether and how collective memories may have been enhanced or how new communities of memory have been created and to describe their nature and form.

Lastly, historical research in the field of archival science might be required to determine whether and how there is any potential effect on the inherent value and meaning of records by using new enabling technologies to integrate public and private collections and to improve the usability of archival materials.

<h3>Phase 4</h3>
The data generated and collected in Phase 3 will be analyzed and interpreted. It will be determined whether the general and operational hypotheses have been refuted or supported. Based on this analysis, a final thesis will be drafted that frames the research findings as some general principles and rules.

<h3>Phase 5</h3>
Defend thesis to University of Amsterdam doctoral committee.

‘Web 2.0’ is typically used to refer to the next-generation (i.e. post-dot.com) web trends and technologies that are characterized by open system architectures (e.g. web services, RSS, GoogleMaps API), rich web-clients (e.g. Ajax, Flash), a wide selection of open source tools for publishing and sharing information (e.g. content-management systems, wikis, forums, blogs, photo gallery software), community-based control (e.g. Wikipedia), folksonomy tagging (e.g. Flickr, del.icio.us), personalization (e.g. StumbleUpon, Amazon user profiles), and location-based services (e.g. MobileMuse).

In my research I will explore how the owners and managers of digital archives might take advantage of Web 2.0 technologies and practices to improve the quality and usability of online archives access systems beyond traditional, one-way, search and browse functionality.

The purpose of system requirement specifications is to accurately capture the requirements of the system’s owners, users and stakeholders.<!--more-->

System requirements are drafted to ensure that all parties are in agreement on what system should be built before development and implementation begins and modifications become costly, time-consuming or (yikes!) impossible. System requirement specifications are therefore often used as the basis and criteria for acceptance testing to ensure that the system which has been been built matches the original vision and needs of the system owners, users, and stakeholders.

The most common way to organize system requirements is functionally. System requirements are, in fact, often referred to as functional requirements. Functional requirements state 'what' a system must be able to do without necessarily specifying 'how' it should be done. <ul>
	<li>e.g. 'the system must provide the ability to enter a search query'</li>
</ul>

Functional requirements are typically supported by data requirements and non-functional requirements such as technical requirements, usability requirements or quality requirements.

Data or metadata requirements state what information will be created or used by the system.
<ul>
	<li>e.g. 'the search query will include a query string, name of the collection which is being searched, and the date/time of the query'</li></ul>

Technical requirements are functional requirements that declare the required functionality of the system from the perspective of the technology, standards and features that must be supported by the system. <ul>
	<li>e.g. 'the search query must support boolean logic statements'</li></ul>

Usability requirements declare the required functionality of the system from the perspective of the user and their expectations on how they will interact with the system.
<ul>
	<li>e.g. 'the search query feature will provide context-sensitive help and instructions'</li>
</ul>

Quality requirements are restrictions or expectations on ‘how well’ a functional, technical, data, or user requirement is to be met or the degree to which a function or feature should be provided (these can include criteria for system performance, security or user-friendliness).
<ul>
	<li>e.g. 'the maximum time for the system to return search query results is 3 seconds'</li>
</ul>

There are many different requirements analysis methodologies and practices, each with their own preference for the types of requirements to include and what to call each type. Requirements can be specified textually, using diagrams (e.g. UML, DFD, E-R, IDEF), or a combination of text and diagrams.

Below is a list of quality characteristics for requirement specifications based on software engineering best practices. (1) These are applicable regardless of what methodology or diagram modeling syntax is used.

<h3>Quality Criteria for Requirements Specifications</h3>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Complete</strong>: The functionality to be delivered is fully and accurately described. All of the information necessary to design and implement the system functionality is provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Unambiguous</strong>: All readers of the requirement specification will be able to arrive at a single consistent interpretation of the description.</li>
	<li><strong>Consistent</strong>: Any one requirement specification should not conflict with another requirement.</li>
	<li><strong>Valid</strong>: Only the functionality that is within the system’s scope and that has been approved by the system owner is described.</li>
	<li><strong>Feasible</strong>: Only the functionality that may be realistically implemented within the known capabilities of existing technologies and the known capacity and resources of the system owner is described.</li>
	<li><strong>Prioritized</strong>: An indication is given whether the requirement is mandatory or optional. Within these two categories, each requirement is ranked in order of importance against other requirements.</li>
	<li><strong>Unique</strong>: Each requirement specification will be uniquely identified so that it can be distinctly referred to and to allow for the maintenance of a requirement revision history.</li>
	<li><strong>Traceable</strong>: The requirement specifications will be organized in such a way that they can be linked to their source, to additional design documentation, to software and hardware components within the deployed system and to test cases that verify the correct implementation of the requirements.</li>

The first version of this core set of system requirements will be based on work I've done in some previous consulting projects. It assumes the viewpoint of a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/08/digital-archives/"">digital archives</a> that captures, preserves and provides access to 'born-digital' information and not that of a traditional archives reference service that provides access to analogue archival materials to patrons in a physical reference room.

The two primary inputs to the first version of this core set of requirements is the ISO Standard: Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model (1) and the InterPARES Project's Model of the Preservation Function (2). Each of the requirements listed below is traceable to at least one citation from these two sources.

I will update this core set as my research progresses. Obviously this first version requires additional context, definitions, etc.. It is also does not include requirements that provide any Web2.0 features or practices.

It's main purpose is to acquire, preserve and provide access to collections of <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/08/archival-materials/"">archival materials</a>.

Examples of archival institutions include the Rijksarchief of the Netherlands, the City of Vancouver Archives or the Greenpeace Archives. Visit the <a href=""http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=5761&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html"">UNESCO Archives Portal</a> to see more examples of archival institutions from around the world.<!--more-->

The term 'Archives' is also frequently used but this term can be confused for the archival materials themselves or the physical place where they are stored rather than the institution that is managing them.

The term 'archives', as a matter of fact, has acquired many meanings and definitions. Professional archivists are still bitter about the term being subjegated by the technologists to use in narrow contexts such as a mailing list archives or a blog archives (that is to say nothing about the adjective 'archival' being used as a noun by vendors to mean something like long-term storage and preservation).

The main reason for defining archival institutions here is that, within the context of <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/research-topi/"">my research topic</a>, I want to make a distinction between organizations that are professionaly managed and funded to provide access to archival materials and those collections that are managed by private individuals as personal digital archives (whether that is on their home computer or with the assistance of external services and tools).

I am therefore, not so concerned about distinguishing between archival institutions, libraries and museums which often goes along the lines of:
1) archives collect primary, unpublished materials in documentary form (e.g. papers, records, documents)
2) libraries collect published and produced works (e.g. books, movies, music)
3) museums collect three-dimensional, non-documentary artifacts (e.g. objects)

These 'memory' institutions have always been closely related in function and form, even more so now in the digital world. There are some real and some arbitrary differences between them but I am not concerned or interested in addressing these as the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/archival-science/"">theoretical framework</a> of my research is concerned with any type or format of digital information that acts as memory and evidence.","Archival Institutions","0",,"publish","open","open",,"archival-institutions",,,"2005-11-06 15:23:41","2005-11-06 22:23:41",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=21","0","post",,"0"

At its most basic level, information is a message that is communicated from a sender to a receiver using some type of recognizable pattern (e.g. sounds, symbols, signs).  An information object is an entity with form and structure that conveys a message according to a recognizable pattern (e.g. a document, a movie, a song). Information objects can be stored on a variety of media including paper, video cassette, audio cassette, photographic film, DVD, magnetic hard disk, etc..

Within the context of my <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/research-topi/"">research topic</a>, I am interested in archival materials in digital form or 'digital information objects' that serve as evidence and memory.

Digital information objects must be understood, managed and preserved at three levels: as physical objects, as logical objects, and as conceptual objects.  At the physical level, digital information objects are simply an inscription of signs (e.g. 1’s and 0’s) to a medium (e.g. magnetic disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, etc). At the logical level these physical bitstreams are interpreted by software according to a language or set of rules that give the digital information object a recognizable form and structure (e.g. ASCII text, JPG image). The conceptual object is the entity that has meaning and value in a real-world context (e.g. a webpage, a photograph, a report, etc.).","Archival Materials","0",,"publish","open","open",,"archival-materials",,,"2005-11-08 16:57:30","2005-11-08 23:57:30",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/08/archival-materials/","0","post",,"0"

‘Long-term’ refers to a period of time which is long enough to be concerned about the impacts of changing technologies, including support for new media and data formats, and with a changing user community, on the information being held in a repository. This period extends into the indefinite future.

Ensuring long-term access to digital information is a complex challenge that includes issues such as:
<ol><li>storage media instability and deterioration</li>
<li>technology obsolescence and incompatibility (at the level of: hardware, system software, application software, data and file formats, storage media readers and drivers)</li>
<li>lack of metadata which results in the failure to locate information, the inability to render and read the information, or the inability to attribute meaning or value to the information due to the lack of contextual information</li>
<li>lack of clearly assigned responsibilities and resources for long-term preservation</li>
</ol>

Cornell University Library provides a good introduction to these issues as well as a basic <a href=""http://www.library.cornell.edu/iris/tutorial/dpm/index.html"">tutorial on digital preservation</a>.

The Open Archival Information System (<a name =""oais"" href=""http://archivemati.ca/bibliography/#ISO-reference_model"">OAIS</a>) model (ISO standard 14721) is a high-level reference model that is being used by organizations world-wide to build further understanding, consensus, and interoperability for organizations that are implementing digital archives to address digital preservation issues.

The OAIS presents a comprehensive logical model describing all of the roles, functions and entities of a typical digital archives without committing to specific technologies, methodologies or management frameworks.

 <img src=""http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/OAIS.gif"" alt=""Open Archival Information System - reference model"" width=""663"" height=""395""/>

<p></p>
<p><h3>OAIS Responsibilities</h3>
The primary concept in the OAIS is that of an ‘archival information system’ which is defined as “an organization of people and systems that has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a designated community.” It establishes six primary responsibilities that must be met:

<ol><li>Negotiate for and accept appropriate information from information producers.</li>
<li>Obtain sufficient control of the information in order to meet long-term preservation objectives.</li>
<li>Determine the scope of the archive’s user community.</li>
<li>Ensure that the preserved information is independently understandable to the user community, without requiring the assistance of the information producer.</li>
<li>Follow documented policies and procedures to ensure the information is preserved against all reasonable contingencies, and to enable dissemination of authenticated copies of the preserved information in its original form, or in a form traceable to the original. </li>
<li>Make the preserved information available to the user.</li></ol></p>

<p></p>
<p><h3>OAIS Roles</h3>
There are three primary roles in the OAIS model: management, producer and consumer.
<ol><li>Management’s responsibilities include formulating, revising, and in some circumstances, enforcing, the high-level policy framework governing the activities of the digital archives.</li>
<li>Producers submit the information objects to be preserved, along with associated metadata, to the digital archives via an ingest process, which accepts the submitted information and prepares it for inclusion in the archival store.</li>
<li>Consumers are the individuals, organizations, or systems expected to access and use the information objects preserved by the digital archives.</li></ol></p>

<p><h3>OAIS Functions</h3>
The OAIS is organized into 6 high-level functions or services.
<ol><li>Ingest is the set of processes responsible for accepting information submitted by Producers and preparing it for inclusion in the archival store.</li>
<li>Archival Storage is the function of the system that manages the long-term storage and maintenance of digital materials entrusted to the digital archives.</li>
<li>The Data Management function maintains databases of descriptive metadata identifying and describing the archival material in support of the digital archives access aids. It also manages the administrative data supporting the digital archives' internal system operations, such as system performance data or access statistics.</li>
<li>Preservation Planning is the service that is responsible for mapping out the digital archives' preservation strategy, as well as recommending appropriate revisions to this strategy in response to evolving conditions in the digital archives' environment. </li>
<li>The Access function manages the processes and services by which Consumers locate, request, and receive delivery of objects residing in the archival store.</li>
<li>The Administration function is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the digital archives, as well as coordinating the activities of the other five high-level services.</li></ol></p>


<p><h3>OAIS Information Packages</h3>
The entities within the OAIS are based on the concept of an information package: a conceptualization of the structure of information as it moves into, through, and out of the digital archives. An information package consists of the digital information object that is the focus of preservation, along with metadata necessary to support its long-term preservation and access, bound into a single logical package.

The OAIS recognizes three primary types of information packages:

<ol><li>The Submission Information Package (SIP), is the version of the information package that is transferred from the Producer to the digital archives when information is 'ingested'.  </li>
<li>The Archival Information Package (AIP) is the version of the information package that is stored and preserved by the digital archives. The AIP consists of the information that is the focus of preservation, accompanied by a complete set of metadata sufficient to support the digital archives' preservation and access services.</li>
<li>The Dissemination Information Package (DIP) is the version of the information package delivered to the Consumer in response to an access request.</li></ol></p>

<p>Within the context of my <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/research-topi/"">research topic</a>, I am primarily interested in the services provided as part of the Access function of digital archives. I have used the term 'archives access systems' to distinguish it as that component or sub-system within a digital archives that makes the Access service available.</p>","Digital Archives","0",,"publish","open","open",,"digital-archives",,,"2005-11-08 17:07:41","2005-11-09 01:07:41",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=27","0","post",,"0"

In true Web 2.0 fashion, I expect the most comprehensive and accurate definition to be available on Wikipedia at some point in the near future. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Web_2.0&oldid=27931630"">current (Nov 10, 2005) version</a> is, in fact, not bad. [the most recent version is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"">available here</a>]

Within the context of <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/research-topi/"">my research topic</a> I am interested in new web technologies and practices that can improve the functionality and usability of archives access systems. Therefore, rather than dwell on the meaning and future of Web 2.0, I am going to simply use the term as a point of entry to identify and analyze specific architectures, technologies and practices (regardless of what those may be referred to collectively a year from now).

Below is a short list from my notes on Web 2.0 thus far. I have organized them along three viewpoints - Users, Technology, Service Providers:

1. Users
======
1.1 Personal Publishing - Blogging, Picture Sharing, Bookmark Sharing
1.2 Collective Intelligence - Collaborative Maintenance of Information Collections, Wikis, Forums, Commenting, Tagging, Profiling
1.3 Social Software - Social Networks, Shared virtual spaces, Collective Experience/Memory
1.4 Do it yourself, take ownership, request features, build features
1.5 High Signal to Noise ratio - confusion - scattered services and interfaces. New technologies and information delivery channels. What is trackback? Why do I need an aggregator?
1.6 Loss of control or orientation over personal information universe? How do I backup my blog? Who's minding my data? Where's my data? My pictures are on Flickr, my bookmarks at del.icio.us, my blog is on blogger.com, my email is in Yahoo!Mail, my videos are on OurMedia.org, 'what?! you want me to create another user profile!'

2. Technology
==========
2.1 Rich Client - AJAX
2.2 Rich Client - FLASH
2.3 Live Web - Syndication (RSS), Trackback
2.4 Permalinks - clean URLs
2.5 Standards Compliance - XHTML, CSS
2.6 Tags - keyword-driven information architecture

3. Service Providers
==============
3.1 Web As A Platform - Software as a Service, web services/apis
3.2 Web As A Platform - Open Access/Open Content/Open Data
3.3 Loose coupling - facilitate lightweight integration
3.4 Model-View-Controller frameworks- seperate data from logic from presentation, reduce development time
3.5 Device-independent information - PC, cellphone, gaming device, mp3 players (podcasting)
3.6. The Long Tail - all the little, specific services and information collections that provide a high quality product but may only be useful or relevant to a small proportion of online users are, collectively, just as significant and powerful as the handful of large, all-in-one services and information collections
3.7 Decentralize - trust users
3.8 Permanent Beta - release crap with no documentation and hope that lots of people get sucked into testing and bug fixing while VCs line up to shower you with cash ;-)","What is Web 2.0?","0",,"publish","open","open",,"what-is-web-20",,,"2005-11-10 15:53:45","2005-11-10 23:53:45",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=22","0","post",,"3"
"22","2","2005-11-18 17:30:26","2005-11-19 01:30:26","I attended an informative <a href=""http://www.van2.ca/event-november"">Van2 presentation</a> on Sxore last night. Sxore is an identity and reputation management tool for blogs that is being developed by the local (Vancouver) Identity 2.0 firm <a href=""http://sxip.com/"">Sxip</a>. My main interest was actually in the Sxip platform that Sxore is built on because Identity 2.0 technology will be an important component of a comprehensive <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/28/personal-digital-archives/"">personal digital archives</a> solution.<!--more-->

Identity 2.0 is a term that is being used to describe the next-generation of identity and reputation management that is user-centric and user-controlled rather than the currently de-centralized model where the end-user has a seperate, completely un-related relationship with every website or online service that we use. This includes the problem of having to maintain multiple usernames and passwords and having to fill out profiles and personal information from scratch every time you join a new website or request a new service. The holy grail of Identity 2.0 is a single sign-on, single user profile for the entire digital realm.

On top of that, Identity 2.0 seeks to leverage the reputation that you might have with one provider (e.g. Ebay's credibility rating) to use in other online relationships using a 'network of trust'. Of course, this concept can be used to seperate legimate online users from those darn spammers, which is where Sxip's Sxore comes in.

What interests me in particular about the <a href=""http://sxip.com/sxip_network"">Sxip architecture</a> is that it aims to put the control over the user's online identity and personas in the hands of the individual rather than any one company, organization or government. This is important from the perspective of privacy and control. As a user I would be able to determine which website or service provider gets to see my personal information and how much they get to see. I can also create multiple personas to seperate the different roles we play online.

Most importantly, from my perspective as a digital archivist, I have the option to store and control this information where I like, using either a trusted host of my choosing (a 'Homesite') or even on my own computer (a 'Personal Homesite'). I don't like having my personal information scattered all over cyberspace where there are constantly reports of identity thefts, including breaches of security at government servers, banks, credit bureaus and credit card companies (all of these in the past year alone here in Canada!!!). I would rather take my chances with storing my identity profiles on a 'Personal Homesite' as part of my own personal digital archives solution that I've designed to meet basic security and business continuity requirements.

Of course, for any one identity architecture and solution to succeed it will require mass adoption and end-user trust (remember Microsoft Passport?). It will be some time before a user-centric, single sign-on solution is available for all online interactions across the digital realm (online shopping, banking, government services, etc). The early adopters will be Web 2.0 savy companies and websites that already subscribe to the ethos and benefits of open systems and open data.

There are some other interesting initiatives in this domain including <a href=""http://lid.netmesh.org/wiki/Main_Page"">Lightweight ID</a>, the <a href=""http://www.projectliberty.org/"">Liberty Alliance</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.identitycommons.net/"">Identity Commons</a>.

I personally like the user-centric vision and comprehensive architecture of the Sxip approach, which includes third-party authentication. I am also encouraged by their recent collaboration with IETF.   I am looking forward to the upcoming release of the Sxip 2.0 protocol and tools so that I can prototype a personal digital archives interface.

To learn more about the concepts and goals of Identity 2.0 I highly recommend the streaming video of Dick Hardt's fast-moving <a href=""http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/"">OSCON2005 presentation</a>.

The <a href=""http://www.identityblog.com/stories/2004/12/09/thelaws.html"">Laws of Identity</a> are also an excellent read. They establish the basic principles that 'define a unifying identity metasystem that can offer the Internet the identity layer it so obviously requires.' These help to establish a basic roadmap for the future of digital identity management that goes beyond a particular standard, technology or product.  This is important as I suspect the road to Identity 2.0 nirvana (single sign-on for the entire digital realm, personal control over digital identity) might still have some twists and curves ahead.","Identity 2.0 and Personal Digital Archives","0",,"publish","open","open",,"identity-20-and-personal-digital-archives",,,"2005-11-18 17:30:26","2005-11-19 01:30:26",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=28","0","post",,"4"
"23","2","2005-12-07 14:52:02","2005-12-07 22:52:02","I had lunch with fellow UBC <a href=""http://www.slais.ubc.ca"">SLAIS</a> alumni Mark Jordan yesterday. We both speak a-mile-a-minute so this was a very productive exchange of information. Mark was the resourceful and over-worked lab technician when we were both students at SLAIS. Today he is the resourceful and over-worked <a href=""http://www.sfu.ca/~mjordan/"">head systems librarian</a> at Simon Fraser University (but somehow still finds time to post regularly to his <a href=""http://digitizationblog.interoperating.info/"">digitizationblog</a>).<!--more-->

<h3>Book</h3>
He is currently on sabbatical to write a book entitled <em><a href=""http://chandospublishing.com/catalogue/record_detail.php?recordID=104"">Putting Content Online: A Practical Guide for Libraries</a></em>, which U.K. publisher Chandos will put out in September 2006. I have had a sneak preview of some in-progress chapters and I can already tell you, quite confidently, that this book will be a must-read for anyone that is involved in managing digital collections, regardless of whether you work in a library or in another type of organization.

In the book Mark uses his considerable experience and knowledge to navigate the sometimes overwhelming and still evolving sea of information related to digital collections workflow, best practices, standards, technology, tools, and management considerations. However, he only dwells on the theory and standards long enough to get on with the driving focus of the book, which is how to successfully put (and keep, and manage) your digital content online. Mark is a do-er and the real value and utility of this book will stem from his pragmatic vision and experience.

<h3>Prototype</h3>
It was particulary useful for me to get some feedback from Mark yesterday about the prototyping work I hope to start shortly on an <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/category/archives-access-systems/"">archives access system</a>. One of the first decisions I will have to make is whether to adopt and adapt an existing open source content management system (CMS) or whether to build a system from scratch. I have been looking very closely at three options from the digital library community: <a href=""http://www.fedora.info/"">Fedora</a>, <a href=""http://www.greenstone.org"">Greenstone</a> and <a href=""http://www.dspace.org/"">Dspace</a>.

I have also taken <a href=""http://drupal.org/"">Drupal</a>, a website content management system, for a spin. Drupal is the CMS that is being used to manage the front-end for the <a href=""http://www.ourmedia.org"">OurMedia.org</a> digital archives and I was very interested to find out that Mark has recently been testing <a href=""http://digitizationblog.interoperating.info/?p=222"">Drupal as a digital library CMS</a>.

Drupal's has a very flexible plug-in architeture and a wide array of already available modules that make it a feature-rich, ready-to-rock platform. As Mark has found in his prototyping, the <em>flexinode</em> and <em>taxonomy</em> modules in particular are very useful as starting points for managing the intellectual control  of a digital collection (e.g. cataloging, authority files, controlled vocabularies).

However, each of these existing systems comes with their own architecture legacies, design assumptions and technology dependencies. They are all making a concious effort to evolve to true modular architectures (Greenstone v.3 and Fedora v.2 in particular) by leveraging web services technology to avoid locking themselves down as a vertical stove-pipe platform. Nevertheless, part of the attraction for me in my upcoming prototyping work is to build an archives management system from scratch that uses multi-level archival description and the management of archival materials as its initial point of entry, not as an add-on further down the line.

Therefore, I am likely going to study and copy these existing CMS systems where they have been succesful but will look to develop my own prototype from scratch (yes, here comes yet another CMS). At the same time I will be looking to take advantage of the modularity of these other systems so that the system that I am developing will be able to interface with digital repositories that are managed using one or another of these CMSes.

The next question then becomes what platform to build the prototype on? I want it to be a web-based system therefore adopting a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller"">Model-View-Controller</a> framework will be the soundest choice. I have looked at <a href=""http://struts.apache.org/"">Struts</a> (Java), <a href=""http://www.turbogears.org/"">TurboGears</a> (Python), and <a href=""http://cakephp.org/"">Cake</a> (PHP) but must admit that I have been easily influenced by all the hype/glorification/anti-hype around <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org/"">Rails</a> (Ruby).

I am leaving for a family vacation in Mexico this week and my wife has insisted that no laptops are allowed. She doesn't know though that I've packed my newly acquired <em><a href=""http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html"">Agile Web Development with Rails</a></em> book.

"24","2","2005-12-23 15:40:54","2005-12-23 23:40:54","Well, I am back from Ixtapa, Mexico with a decent tan and a very sore back from an unfortunate JetSki incident out in the high surf. Just imagine a Dukes-of-Hazard-style launch off a very large wave. Anyway, I can still type.

As a follow-up to <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/12/07/lunch-book-prototyping/"">my previous post</a>, I've been through the <em>Agile Web Development with Rails</em> book and have been playing around with a test Rails application for the past few days. Here is a short list of some of my <em>first</em> impressions: <!--more-->

<ul>
	<li>I still find the Ruby language a little bit disorienting. I am just a novice programmer (VB.Net, PHP, Javascript, XSLT) but I think I've already become too accustomed to traditional syntax and markup (however ugly or unbeautiful that may be deemed to be by the more experienced programmers)</li>
	<li>I don't like having to create and alter my tables directly in the database. I wish Rails would do this for me, because I am big (SQL) baby.</li>
	<li>The ActiveRecord relationship features are great but the scaffolding views don't auto-generate and auto-populate controls for my foreign keys. I have yet to try many-to-many views but expect this to become challenging when I try to create ones that allow for the selection, editing and updating of both sides of the many-to-many relationship(s) on a single view. There's no way around it. I am going to have to get my hands dirty with SQL and Ruby code.</li>
	<li>I don't think I am going to get a lot out-of-box AJAX/Javascript widgets (e.g. datagrid, menus, tabs, etc.) to create my data-entry screens and advanced search screens (I don't think these are widely available as open-source quite anywhere just yet)
	</li><li>I am not sure about Ruby/Rails Unicode support and how easy it is going to be to internationalize/localize a Rails application</li>
	<li>Rails will give me XML publishing using Builder but I am not sure about the support for importing & reading XML documents</li></ul>

So my initial excitement about Rails has tapered a bit. Now its about the facts not the hype. Before any born-again Rails evangelists get a chance to rush in for an emergency conversion, however, I just want to say that these are very preliminary first impressions and open questions that I need to investigate further to determine whether Rails will be the best tool for the job. Which, by the way, will likely turn into a client project for an international NGO rather than a research prototype as I originally planned, so it's critical that I get my initial 'build or customize' decision right. In the end this will be determined by which platform most closely and elegantly meets the project's business and functional requirements.

On the 'customize' side of the equation I have been losing steam for Drupal. My main concern is over the lack of technical documentation and what appears to be a pretty flat, fat architecture. When I install Drupal or its modules I am not quite sure of what exactly I am getting and where it fits into the big picture. I am going to need to do quite a bit of customization to the node/flexinode/taxonomy modules to support the complicated data structures required for archival description cataloging. Therefore I need to be clear on what the data structure is and would prefer to work with a platform that provides me with some database abstraction. I have also had one too many time-wasting episodes chasing down a missing semi-colon or curly bracket to make me think twice about PHP.

Over in Europe, <a href=""http://www.zope.org/"">Zope</a> and its associated products (<a href=""http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF/index.html"">CMF</a>, <a href=""http://plone.org/"">Plone</a>, <a href=""http://www.cps-project.org/"">CPS</a>) are quite popular as open-source application servers and content management platforms so I've been taking a further look at them. <a href=""http://www.cps-project.org/"">Zope/CPS</a> as a matter of fact may prove to be a useful platform option for any future electronic records management/ECM projects that I may be involved in.

As I was working my way through the Zope material, the underlying Python language slowly slithered into my conciousness. It looks a lot more familiar and comfortable to me than Ruby, yet seems to strike a similarly useful balance between scripting and object-orientation. I won't be able to avoid custom coding regardless of what platform I choose but, at this early stage, doing this with Python seems less threatening to me than PHP or Ruby. Python also has a proven track record and lots of documentation, publications and code libraries.

Giving Python a closer look finally led me to <a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/"">Django</a>, my most recent stop on the never-ending 'platform evaluation mystery tour.' I had briefly looked at the TurboGears MVC platform (also based on Python) but something about Django has really caught my fancy. Django's database abstraction layer seems to be more my speed and style, for one, it lets me define the data model right in Django without having to roundtrip to the database itself. The other features that interest me the most include Django's auto-generated data-entry controls ('admin interface'), the built-in templating support and (most important for the client's business requirements) support for internationalization.

So I am going to install and test the Django framework shortly while I continue to play around with Rails as well. Interestingly, the founder of Django (Adrian Holovaty) and Rails (David Heinemeier Hansson) both live in Chicago so the respective Ruby and Python user groups there hosted a <a href=""http://snakesandrubies.com/event/"">joint presentation</a> to allow each to speak on the strengths and vision for their platform. As new MVC platforms designed for rapid web-application development, the two are actually more similar than different. However, <a href=""http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000545.html"">Hansson summarized</a> the main conceptual difference as Django being a platform focussed on the development of websites (with the inclusion of some higher-level components that the Rails founder <a href=""http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2005/11/11/why-engines-and-components-are-not-evil-but-distracting"">wants to avoid</a>) versus Rails as a toolkit for building web-based applications.","Build or Customize?

"25","2","2005-12-31 14:16:27","2005-12-31 22:16:27","The BBC has the largest broadcast media archives in the world and the BBC Archives is certainly one of the more progressive institutions when it comes to using and providing access to its archival materials. Foremost in these efforts is the much publicized plan to <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/08_august/24/dyke_dunn_lecture.shtml"">open the contents of their archives</a> for non-commerical re-use (under a <a href=""http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/"">Creative Commons-style license</a>).

Therefore, when I visited their website to find out more about their 'Creative Archives' initiative, I was a little surprised and amused to see that the <a href=""http://www.bbcresearchcentral.com/archives.html"">BBC Research Services</a> website did not have an online search feature for their archives.

<img src='/wp-content/images/BBCresearchServicessearch.gif' alt='BBC Research Services - Search ' />

<!--more-->

Instead it encouraged me to talk to one of their humanoid research staff who are pictured in an accompanying photo showing them all to be young, stylish, alert and presumably armed with search-engine-like powers to juggle recall and relevance while finding exactly the document or clip that I didn't know I was looking for.

Being easily distracted by their clever searchbox graphic, I first thought that this was yet another innovative development by the BBC. I assumed that they had gone through a careful and deliberate analysis of the effectiveness of their search technology, <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/28/archives-access-systems/"">online access system</a> and reference services and decided that, in the end, they could best serve their clientele with one-to-one, personalized research service, abadoning an expensive and bulky access system in the process.

This may very well have been the case but then I realized that this is more likely to be a clever ruse to disguise the fact that they do not have an integrated access system and that they rely, like so many archival organizations, on a myriad of finding aids, indexes, stand-alone databases and tacit staff knowledge about where to search for and find relevant materials.

It sounds like the BBC is in the midst of some major technical infrastructure overhauls to support its Creative Archives initiative. Therefore online search access to all of their archival holdings may well be in the cards for the near future. In the meanwhile you can ring up someone on their team to track down a copy of the 1966 World Cup Final or Princess Diana's wedding.

<em>postscript:</em> in all fairness to the BBC, they do provide online access to portions of their collections in some interesting and innovative ways. See for example:

If your hard disk is a trooper and keeps spinning away long beyond the manufacturer's warranty (3-5 years), there's still the chance that your computer will be stolen or damaged by virus, fire, electrical storm, flood, kids, pets or a plague of locusts. If you don't take some action now, you will eventually lose your digital documents, pictures, music, and videos...and that would suck.

Therefore,  anyone that is serious about maintaining personal digital archives must have a backup plan.  In fact, I would argue that if you don't have a backup routine you are not maintaining a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/08/digital-archives/"">digital archives</a> but you are just storing some digital data. Anyone that is actually managing a digital archives is committed to maintaining long-term accessibility to their digital collections. This includes providing ways to organize, find and use your digital information but also having a backup plan to deal with storage disaster and a preservation plan to deal with technological obsolensence and incompatibility. I will investigate the organization, retrieval and preservation of digital information over the course of <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/research-topi/"">my research</a>. Right now I want to talk about backup because I've just implemented a new backup routine for my own digital archives.<!--more-->

<h2>Backup Options</h2>There are <a href=""http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2Farchive%2Fl0903%2F35l03%2F35l03%2Easp&articleid=14340&guid=1E8B59ED59DA447193FAD2185EC1CC70&searchtype=0&WordList=BACK+PRECIOUS+DATA&bJumpTo=True"">different ways to organize a backup job</a> (e.g. snapshots, incremental, differential, synchronization). Each of these are supported by different types of backup software and different types of storage media. For my personal digital archives I prefer to use a synchronization technique to replicate my digital archives on another hard disk. All this means is that I maintain an exact copy of my files in as close to real time as possible. When I add, edit or erase a file, the same action is automatically taken on the matching file in my backup. I prefer this to other types of backup because when I rename or reorganize my file directories or weed out files from my collections, I don't want to have to repeat that work should I need to restore from my backup.

Anyway, I don't want to go too much further into the boring details of the different ways to organize backups. I'll summarize by saying that the primary options for the average user include:

<ol>
	<li>the cumbersome chore of burning gigabytes of digital data to stacks of CDs or DVDs</li>
	<li>backing up to an external hard drive</li>
        <li>paying through the nose per gigabyte for an online backup service</li>
	<li>using all those spare gigabytes on your Mom's, friend's or work computer to replicate your digital data</li></ol>

I recently chose to implement option #4. Here's why.

<h2>1. Burning backup to CD or DVD</h2>Home computers don't ship with tape cartridge drives (most commonly used in enterprise settings for backup) so most users that are concerned about losing files have at one time or another backed up their data to CD or DVDs. Given the huge size of our ever-growing personal digital collections, this can take a lot of discs and is a manual process that requires patience and diligence. Not too many people can keep up this routine. I kept it up sporadically for a couple of years. Thankfully, I never had to rely on any of these CD backups because there would have been some major gaps in lost data.

<h2>2. External Hard Drive</h2>I eventually got a <a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1749336,00.asp"">Maxtor One-Touch</a> external hard drive. It plugs into your USB port and comes with backup/replication software. You press the button on the front of the external disk drive and it automatically copies over any new or changed files from your computer since the last time you pressed the button. Very handy. This was much easier to maintain than a set of backup CDs. Anytime that I downloaded baby pictures from my camera to my computer I just hit the OneTouch button and I felt somewhat comforted by the fact that our precious memories would survive if the PC hard disk gave out (which I should clarify, it never has, but obviously I live in perpetual fear that one day it will).

However, I was always aware that this routine did not protect me in case someone broke into my house and stole my PC and external hard disk (which was sitting right next to it) or if our house were to be wiped out in a fire or flood. A colourful way to summarize the need for maintaining a backup copy of your information in a second, off-site location is <em>The Story of Enoch</em> presented in this <a href=""http://www.fox-gieg.com/shorts-enoch.html"">quirky short animation</a> by Nick Fox-Gieg (<em>turn up your sound, then press the play button below</em>).

</embed></p>


To avoid having all of my digital archives knocked out by flood, fire or some other type of location-specific disaster, biblical or otherwise,  I started lugging the Maxtor external hard disk to the office every so often to replicate my duplicate on a work computer. Despite being an external hard disk I would be hard pressed to call it portable. It was pretty heavy and akward to transport and I had to fight the wire jungle behind my computer at both locations to unplug and re-plug the USB cable and AC adapter. Also, I was not being consistent about how often I was taking the backup offsite and started to do it less and less considering how much of a hassle it was. This meant that I still stood to lose a significant portion of our digital memories should anything have happened to my home PC.

I was reluctant to look at any other options given the close to $300 I had shelled out for the Maxtor drive. Then the Maxtor helped me to make up my mind when it simply stopped working. For some inexplicable reason the driver software stopped working with all of my WindowsXP machines. I messed around for about a week with support, forums, tracking down and updating drivers, all to no avail. So on to investigate the next setup with preferably as little intervention on my part as possible. The most obvious solution to meet my requirements was an <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,121970,00.asp"">online backup service</a>.

<h2>3. Online Backup Service</h2>I was already using a reliable, stable service (from my ISP <a href=""http://businesscontent.telus.com/webcontent/content/Products/internetData/dataBackup/order.jsp;:Gbie"">Telus</a>) to backup my company data. I pay about $25 per month to backup up to 4GB of data. I can justify this as a business expense. I need to maintain this data for my livelihood. I also have no more than 3GB of business data which I consider a fairly manageable amount for 5 years worth of administrative files, email backups, project files, resource documents, and software application install files from my consulting business.

However, I have at least 10 Gigabytes of digital music and pictures on my personal PC and I've only been collecting digital music and taking digital pictures for a couple of years. Since I am also now beginning to shoot short (but of course sizeable) digital video clips I expect this number to keep growing at a much faster rate over the next couple of years.

About $10-15 per Gigabyte (on average) for a decent online backup service is a tough monthly expense to stomach. I would have trouble shelling out over $500 per year for backup services especially considering that I could buy consumer-grade hard disks at about $1 per Gigabyte, for a one-time cost, not one that repeats month after month. This got me to thinking...what about all that extra storage I have on my work PCs...

<h2>4. Replicating data to a spare, remote PC</h2> Most PCs these days ship with hard disks that have about 80-120GB hard disks. I typically don't use more than 50GB per PC and all I need is about 30 spare Gigabytes to backup my personal digital archives for the next couple of years.

I figured that it would be easy to find some software that would allow me synchronize directories on two PCs remotely. I had been using <a href=""http://www.tgrmn.com/"">ViceVersa</a> to replicate machines on my local network at my office. However, it turns out that to use this or any similar products between remote locations outside of a local network I would basically have to set up my own <a href=""http://computer.howstuffworks.com/vpn.htm"">Virtual Private Network</a> (VPN) to do it reliably and securely and that seemed like overkill to me.

I thought that someone would have created a solution like this on top of <a href=""http://computer.howstuffworks.com/file-sharing2.htm"">a peer-to-peer network like Gnutella</a> but at the time that I was investigating this (November 2005) that didn't seem to be case. I briefly considered developing my own solution using the  open-source <a href=""http://www.ifolder.com/index.php/Home"">iFolder framework</a> or the <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/index.html"">Unison File Synchronizer</a>. However, I simply didn't have the time to go into custom development on this. I needed something that I could install quickly and cheaply.

I did eventually track down <a href=""http://www.beinsync.com/"">a pay service</a> that provided the ability to synchronize files on remote PCs  but at this point I was really adament that I shouldn't have to pay anything for backup storage since I already own sufficient hard disk storage myself and I pay enough already to my ISPs for moving bits and bytes over the phone lines.

The only two free services I could find were <a href=""http://buddybackup.com/"">BuddyBackup</a> and <a href=""http://www.foldershare.com"">Foldershare</a>. The first was a brand new beta launch but the second was a former commercial service that was just bought out my Microsoft and now offered for free. Unfortunately, the BuddyBackup beta crashed on me a couple of times and since the creators of BuddyBackup were not willing to release it as an open-source project and were hinting that <a href=""http://groups.google.ca/group/buddybackup/browse_thread/thread/edd35e90629fc502/5bbd2897a0356c60?lnk=st&q=buddybackup&rnum=3&hl=en#5bbd2897a0356c60"">it was to become a fee-based service</a> I was reluctant to invest too much time in debugging and being a testing guineau pig.

This left me with the Microsoft solution (<em>FolderShare</em>). I was (and still am) distrustful about Microsoft providing a free service and having them move my data around. I expect them to start charging for this service at some point in the future and I half imagine Bill Gates' evil twin in some dark Redmond lab mining everyone's backup data to build the ultimate global mind control system. But that's just being delusionally paranoid. The most likely sinister scenario would be some type of targeted advertising scheme along the lines of the <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/03/google_mail_is_evil_privacy/"">Google Gmail controversy</a>.

Anyway, for the time being I'll believe that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsa"">RSA authentication</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"">AES encryption</a> via <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer"">SSL</a> that the service offers is secure and trustworthy. I have also disabled web access to my files so that they can only be accessed and used in decrypted form on the PCs that are the peer nodes in my own network.

To be fair, the FolderShare setup and configuration was a breeze and it just works very simply and very well, as advertised:

<a href=""https://www.foldershare.com/info/help/learnSync.php?"" border=""0"" style=""text-decoration: none; border: 0;""><img src=""/wp-content/images/showMeSync.gif"" style=""border: 2 solid black;"" /></a>

This setup has taken all the manual hassle out of keeping my backups up to date. Any changes I make to my files are automatically updated in the background and uploaded to the other, off-site computer when both are on (I leave my work computer running). I have also found it handy now to make changes or additions to my personal digital archives files while I am at work rather than having to wait until I am at home to download pictures from my cellphone or move a new MP3 file into my music library, for example.

I myself have decided to share the extra storage space on my home and office PCs for my remote backup but I expect that most people using this type service will be making arrangements with trusted family and friends to share spare storage on their respective computers.

The only restrictions on the Foldershare service is that each account is limited to 10 libraries with 10,000 files each. This meant that I had to create a few top-level libraries for my main content groups rather than being able to just set the service to work on  the MyDocuments folder as a whole. This is, in fact, where I expect them to introduce 'premium, pay-for-use service' at some point in the future (i.e. allowing you to increase the number of libraries and files per library for a fee). Right now my pictures library is at 4000 files and my music library is at 2000 files so I should be o.k. for a while.

The other restriction is that the service only moves one file at a time per library. This means that the initial synchronization of the libraries took about 2.5 days. However, once this baseline was established the libraries sync almost instantly once new files are added.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>Using peer-to-peer and synchronization technology to maintain a near-to-real-time backup of my personal digital archives is the only way to go for me. I essentially set it and forget it and I am not paying someone month after month for storage that I already own. My data is also stored on machines that I have full control over rather than servers in a data center that I have to trust exists somewhere and is being run securely and effectively.

I will be keeping a close, skeptical eye on the Foldershare business model and policies and may move on to (or develop if I have to) a true open-source and free alternative in the future . However, for the time being I am very satisfied with this service.

<em>[UPDATE (FEB, 23/06): I have recently run into a Foldeshare glitch when I included my Microsoft Outlook .pst file in one of my Foldershare synchronization libraries. Unfortunately, Foldershare keeps trying to overwrite my current .pst file on my primary computer with an older version that was synced to one of my secondary computers. I believe it is because the secondary computer assigns the copy of the .pst file a new modified date/timestamp when it is finished writing on that machine. That timestamp is usually more current than the one on the primary computer, namely because I open the file on my primary computer first thing in the morning and it usually stays open until I log off at the end of the day. This means its timestamp doesn't get updated until that point in time. This wouldn't be such a big deal except Foldershare basically goes into a crazy loop trying to sync the file with the secondary copy but my system won't allow it because the same file is currently open on my primary computer. This means that all other Foldershare activity is suspended and I keep getting a nagging pop-up displayed on my screen about this 'error' that Foldershare is experiencing.

My Outlook .pst file is obviously one of my critical day-to-day business files as it handles all my email correspondence, contacts and scheduling information. Unfortunately, this means I have to use a second set of tools (a combination of Vice/Versa and my Telus online backup service) to synchronize and do an off-site backup of this file.

According to the <a href=""https://www.foldershare.com/info/faq/UsingFolderShare.php?"">FolderShare FAQ</a>, this problem occurs when additional copies of MS-Outlook are opened on the secondary computers but I am experiencing this problem even though the two secondary computers to which this library is synced do not have an open copy of Outlook running. Now that Foldershare is a Microsoft company you would think and hope that they address this issue shortly as .pst files are a common and important file for most personal and professional desktop users. I have submitted this issue to FolderShare support, let's see what the response will be...]</em>","A New Backup Routine for My Personal Digital Archives","0",,"publish","open","open",,"a-new-backup-routine-for-my-personal-digital-archives",,,"2006-01-13 21:28:43","2006-01-14 05:28:43",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=32","0","post",,"20"

Thus far <a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/"">Django</a> has come closest to meeting my particular set of requirements and preferences, thanks in large part to its excellent documentation, its powerful and easy to use object-to-relational model, and its killer administration interface that is automatically generated from the model definition.

However, I have put these three 'pure' MVC frameworks on hold while I test out whether <a href=""http://drupal.org"">Drupal</a> is going to meet my basic functional and technical requirements.
<!--more-->
The main reason for this shift is that two local acquaintances, who are actively developing with Drupal, have been urging me to give it a try as a high-level web application toolkit. Also, the timing is right because in a couple of weeks Vancouver will be host to the <a href=""http://oscms-summit.org/"">Open Source Content Management Systems</a> (OSCMS) conference which is offering many Drupal-specific sessions. This will allow me to test-drive Drupal in the next couple of weeks and to fill any knowledge gaps with OSCMS sessions and follow-up questions to the contingent of core Drupal developers that will be attending the conference. I can decide at that point whether to return to my Django prototyping or whether to blaze forward with Drupal.

<h2><a name=""MVC"">Model - View - Controller (MVC)</a></h2>I had considered Drupal as an option earlier but I had been swayed by all the buzz in the tech press and blogosphere about the new generation of open source MVC frameworks that are promising to improve the speed and quality of web application development.

Implicit in these frameworks is the idea that a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller"">Model, View, Controller</a> (MVC) structure is the best design pattern for architecting web applications. A MVC architecture seperates a web application into three primary layers. The model layers abstracts a domain-specific data model and interacts with the data persistence layer on its behalf (usually a database but could also be XML or text files). The Controller interacts with the user through an interface (e.g. a webpage). The Controller receives information or requests from the user, routes these to the appropriate place in the application and returns the application's response to the user. The View layer  adds presentation templates (e.g. styles, themes, etc.) to the data that comes from the model layer, before it is sent back to the user interface by the Controller.

MVC architectures improve the development, scalability and on-going maintenance of web applications by dividing their critical components into seperate layers that can enhanced or exchanged without affecting the other layers (in theory). They follow the software engineering paradigm of seperating data persistence from application logic from presentation. Before the advent of RubyOnRails, TurboGears and Django, MVC type architectures had already been deployed successfully for a number of years (e.g. Apache Struts, Java Server Faces, WebObjects).

Since Drupal has been around a bit longer than the more recent MVC frameworks, it never thought to sell itself to new developers like myself as a MVC framework. It started out as website content management system and has grown over the past five years into a swiss army knife type toolkit for building websites that is host to an active community of contributors.

The main reason that I strayed away from Drupal earlier was that I had doubts about how well Drupal could serve as a toolkit for web applications instead of just websites. The main distinction being that web applications require the ability to configure custom data models specific to the domain of the application (archival description in my case). These data models must support basic one-to-many and many-to-many type relationships between the objects, something that all three of the new MVC frameworks do very well.

<h2>Resource Description Format (RDF)</h2>Although Drupal provided the ability to define custom content types through its Flexinode module it has never provided the ability to establish relationships between nodes (its core content objects). However, that has recently changed. There are now a number of Drupal modules in the works that seek to address this shortcoming. The most promising and exciting of which is Dan Morrison's <a href=""http://coders.co.nz/drupal_development/?q=node/6"">RDF Metadata Module</a> (particularly for the archivists, librarians and semantic web fanatics amongs us).

This module enables the concept of subject-predicate-object relationships (referred to as 'triples' in the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/"">Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF) community). For example:

<ul>
	<li>ThisBlogArticle (subject) HAS AUTHOR (predicate) Peter (object)</li>
	<li>ThisBlogArticle (subject) IS PART OF (predicate) Archivmati.ca (object).</li>
</ul>

The RDF Metadata Module uses <a href=""http://dublincore.org/dcregistry/detailServlet?reqType=detail&item=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fdc%2Felements%2F1.1%2Frelation"">Dublin Core relation element</a> as default predicates. It abstracts much of the heavy theory and syntax that underpins RDF standards and unleashes the power provided by these 'rich' relationships. In fact, by providing RDF triples support, Drupal stands to one-up the other MVC frameworks which only support one-dimensional relationships by default.

<h2>Drupal as a MVC Framework</h2>I have yet to install and test the RDF Metadata module to confirm whether it delivers as advertised but from what I can tell right now, the RDF Metadata Module (or other upcoming Drupal 'relationship' modules/APIs) have filled the last missing piece of the puzzle that allows Drupal to be conceptualized as a MVC framework:

<img src='/wp-content/images/Drupal_as_MVC_Framework.png' alt='Drupal as a MVC framework?' />

Of course, this diagram is a rough first draft from a newcomer to Drupal so I expect that it may be scoffed at by Drupal experts and MVC purists. However, I think that the core components are in fact in place. On top of that then is a big bonus (or bonanaza) for web application developers, like myself, that also need to package website cms features with their product. Drupal comes with an orgy of  <a href=""http://drupal.org/handbook/modules"">core </a>and <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/Modules"">contributed</a> modules which are integrated and extensible through what is proving to be a robust <a href=""http://drupaldocs.org/api/head/group/hooks"">hook architecture</a>.

Furthermore, Drupal is a lightweight (a 1.5MB installation!), flexible, and proven platform. Despite some forum chatter about needing an auto-install, Drupal is insanely easy to setup, both locally and on a hosted service, given that most of these are geared to support the Apache/PHP/MySQL configuration that Drupal requires (no messing about with FCGI or mod_python).

I still need to look into how well I can package, brand and deploy custom applications that are built on Drupal as their platform. I am also interested to see how well Drupal is going to be able to integrate AJAX support. One of my other previous complaints about Drupal was that the documentation and, as a result, the system architecture, was awkward to get your head around. However, it appears that there is a Drupal working group that is looking to improve the online documentation. In the meanwhile I have just purchased the <em><a href=""http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10031"">Building Online Communities with Drupal, phpBB and Wordpress</a></em> book and it has helped to answer most of my questions and provided me with the background to draft the <em>'Drupal as a MVC Framework'</em> diagram.

Now if only PHP was as clean, concise and geek-worthy as Ruby or Python...

"28","2","2006-02-07 17:26:16","2006-02-08 01:26:16","Today I gave a presentation on <a href=""http://oscms-summit.org/events/archiving-ensuring-long-term-accessibility-and-usability-of-cms-content"">archiving for CMS</a> at the Open Source Content Management Systems shindig (<a href=""http://oscms-summit.org/schedule"">OSCMS Summit</a>) here in (currently sunny) Vancouver.

This is a PDF copy of my presentation slides: <a href='/wp-content/images/OSCMSSummit_ArchivingPresentation.pdf' target='_blank'>OSCMS Summit: Archiving Presentation</a> (54kb)<!--more-->

We started the presentation with an introduction to some of the basic digital preservation issues that I deal with in my work as a digital archivist. I was surprised at the level of interest in legal requirements for recordkeeping and records retention scheduling during this part of the session (the day-to-day bane of archivists and records managers, including some of my colleagues from the City of Vancouver and Simon Fraser University who came down to sit in on this session at the 'geek conference'). I had assumed that attendees at an open-source content management system conference would be more interested in talking about maintaining the long-term functionality and usability of web content rather than issues around authenticity and legal liability.

We moved on to talk about how digital preservation requirements could be addressed in the context of systems that manage and post content to the web (e.g. content management systems, blogs or wikis).

We talked about the two basic techniques that are available to us today (1) system backup and restore procedures and (2) snapshoting using a webcrawler such as <a href=""http://www.httrack.com/"">HTTtrack</a>.

We then discussed future directions that could improve upon those techniques, namely (1) incorporating data archiving and retention rule worfklows into web content management systems as well as a (2) a standardized preservation format for CMS content types (e.g. posts, articles, static pages, comments, etc.). This led to a discussion about open and/or public file format standards (i.e. <a href=""http://www.aiim.org/standards.asp?ID=25013"">PDF-Archival</a>, <a href=""http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office"">OpenDocument</a>, <a href=""http://structuredblogging.org/"">structured blogging</a> <a href=""http://www.microformats.org/"">microformats</a>, etc.).

We closed by talking about how syndication formats and techniques (e.g. RSS, Atom, XML-RPC) might be used to help in the capture of web content for the purpose of archiving, both from the viewpoint of a website administrator and from the viewpoint of a content owner that has web-based content distributed throughout the web 2.0 universe (e.g. Flickr photos, Blogger posts, del.icio.us tags, etc.).

For me personally, the future direction topics are just at the brainstorming stage right now but I hope to incorporate them at some point into the system prototyping that I am doing as part of <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/research-topi/"">my research into digital archives access</a>.

The <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/tags/oscms/"">first day of the OSCMS conference</a>, by the way, was a big success. We've got developers, administrators, and designers crammed into the three session rooms at UBC Robson centre for some very stimulating and informative sessions. Kudos to Boris Mann, Roland Tanglao and the other organisers for getting this great 'summit' off the ground in such a short period of time. Looking forward to the next couple of days.","Archiving for CMS presentation at OSCMS Summit","0",,"publish","open","open",,"archiving-for-cms-presentation-at-oscms-summit",,,"2006-02-07 17:26:16","2006-02-08 01:26:16",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=35","0","post",,"0"
"29","2","2006-02-16 17:28:23","2006-02-17 01:28:23","Well, this is probably going to dissappoint or upset some of the Drupal developers I have had the pleasure to meet at the recent <a href=""http://oscms-summit.org/"">OSCMS conference</a> but I have decided that I am going to go back to using <a href=""http://djangoproject.com"">Django</a> as the development platform for my upcoming web application project.

I have given Drupal an <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/01/21/drupal-as-a-mvc-framework/"">honest and thorough examination</a> but there are still too many gaps in its ability to define and manage custom domain models. <a href=""http://drupal.org"">Drupal</a> is a great, if not the best CMS out there. Also the community of developers are very cool and motivated. Drupal has a bright future and during the OSCMS conference I was really excited about becoming a part of that but I've had to give my head a shake and face the fact that it may the right community for my project but, unfortunately, it is not the right tool for the job. <!--more-->

What it comes down to is that the next generation Drupal back-end is still in flux and will likely continue to be so until about version 4.8. I need the ability to build and maintain a complex, domain-specific data structure (lots of content types, relationships, inheritance, views, etc.) but Drupal's Content Construction Kit (CCK) and Views Module are in their infancy and, most critically, there is still no official way to handle relationships between Drupal nodes, despite promising starts from the Relativity and RDF  modules. I had briefly considered contributing to the core development and testing, to assist in beginning to stitch these critical pieces together, but I am not really qualified to do so (I am novice programmer and a Drupal newbie) and, most critically, I have to deliver a half-decent prototype in about a month's time.

My original interest in Drupal was stirred by the idea that, if it allowed me to build my required data model as custom nodes, I would get all of Drupal's excellent CMS functionality as a bonus. It turns out that I won't actually need that much CMS functionality to begin with for my application (namely, menuing, theming and user profiles).  It also appears that several of the other Drupal features that I was interested in are also in a period of transition. The new administrative interface is still in the works, theming has been improved by PHPTemplate but I have been left with the impression that theming a Drupal site is still a cumbersome task, file uploads appears to have a number of outstanding issues and internationalization is also in the midst of a re-evaluation. I have full confidence that the talented and motivated Drupal crew will address these issues in due time but it looks like I needed Drupal 4.8 about a year too soon.

At the same time, I have learned a lot of valuable lessons from studying the Drupal architecture and discussing it in detail with the patient core-Drupal developers at OSCMS. I will incorporate many of the Drupal concepts (e.g. ""everything should be a node"") into my Django prototype.

I will post shortly with more details about the actual application I am prototyping and how <a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model_api/"">Django's excellent object-relational mapper</a> gives me most of the functionality I need to support the creation and management of my complex domain model.

In closing, I want to point out that the promise of Web 2.0 is in the concept of the ""web as the platform."" As long as forward thinking developers are incorporating open standards and architectures into their products, what actual product or platform was used to build it will become less and less important. I hope that in the not-too-distant future it will become a non-issue all together and we will instead be discussing functionality, features and interoperability at the information layer (i.e. semantic web, structured blogging, syndication, open file formats, etc.)  rather than at the technology layer and rather than pitting one product or framework against another.

I just watched an excellent webcast presentation by Rick Prelinger of the <a href=""http://www.panix.com/~footage/"">Prelinger Film Archives</a> and one of the people behind the <a href=""http://www.opencontentalliance.org/index.html"">Open Content Alliance</a>.

The ominous title of the presentation ""Are the Archives Doomed?"" is in reference to the growing restrictions on access to archival materials that are due to copyright issues, restrictive archival practices or the poor use of available technology.

This is the <a href=""http://mediasite.cidde.pitt.edu/mediasite/viewer/?cid=0561474e-e57d-4c4d-b8e0-2b6c42bd700c"">link to the webcast</a> provided by the University of Pittsburgh Mediasite.

If you are at all interested in open access, the management of archival institutions or recent trends in archives access you should take the hour to view this presentation.

There are no slides accompanying the presentation and I can't find a transcript anywhere but here are a few juicy quotes from my own notes:<!--more-->

<ul>
	<li>“There’s something I call ‘archival privilege’...Archives used to be able to decide whom to serve and whose requests to ignore and that’s become dangerous behaviour. We used to try and often succeeded in framing the context in which archival material is used, to impose conditions on re-use, to demand credit for re-use and often to control the means by which archival material is represented and published.”</li>

	<li>“Copyright is for lawyers and archives are about preservation and access so I think we need to reclaim the higher ground about copyright...Archival access is being crippled by property laws that most of us had no role in making. Most of us were not part of the conversations that led to the enactment of present day copyright laws</li>

	<li>""I think we are not being Utopian enough, we are reactive. We react to things that people do in other fields. I think we need to think a lot more about where we would like the world of research, scholarship, education, and cultural production to be in the next few years...Just as musicians are sitting down with their fans to talk about what to do about these nasty file-sharing issues, I am wondering why archives users and donors don’t do the same thing?”</li>

	<li>""access means making it as simple and inexpensive for anyone, anywhere, anytime to access copies of works for the broadest possible array of purposes, and whenever possible, I think we should define access expansively and generously.""</li>

	<li>“I realize I am stating the obvious but I’m not sure that everybody in the world realizes that wonderful and unpredictable things happen when ordinary people are given access to primary materials.”</li>

	<li>“I don’t see us [archives] coming to terms with technology. This is not a critical statement, it is a wake-up call. I think we need to push much harder in welcoming technology to our workflows and into the relations between archives and our patrons.”</li>

	<li>“Archives generally consume technology, rather than create it...Archives tend to delegate their technology needs to outside parties…Archives have major unmet technology needs...We don’t have the money. This would tend to favour the development of open-source software. With a few exceptions we are primarily purchasing packages. Imagine a different world. Who couldn’t use an open-source media management system? or a set of open-source DRM tools? or open-source tools to extract structural metadata or to do OCR?...This is where the state-of-the-art activity should be happening.""</li>

"33","2","2006-04-27 15:50:03","2006-04-27 23:50:03","Since I started my blog (late October 2005) I had been successful in posting about once a week.  However,  an entire month and a half has now gone by since my last blog entry.

If I thought that I actually had regular readers I would make an apology for the radio silence. However, I realize that this blog is primarily a vehicle for me personally to organize ideas and track the progress of activities related to my research, so I'll just leave this as a note to myself: <strong>don't forget to blog, it helps to push along your projects and ideas as well as improving your writing process in general.</strong>

O.K. so let's get back on this blogging horse. I do have good reasons for my absence. In March I was busy finishing off an <a href=""http://www.irmt.org/news.html"">intensive client project</a> on integrating records management requirements into Financial Management Information Systems. Then, in early April I went to the Netherlands to visit with <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/phd-administrative-information/"">my research supervisors</a> as well as to finally kick-off a very interesting software development contract that will go hand-in-hand with my research work. Unfortunately, I cannot officially say anything more than that until the client announces the project themselves. However, once they do, I expect to be posting quite regularly about this project as it evolves over the coming months.

<!--more-->

One of the interesting concepts which I picked up from my discussions in the Netherlands is the idea of the 'virtual research room' (as a seperate extension of an archives access system) which is something that Peter Horsman at the <a href=""http://www.archiefschool.nl/engels.htm"">Dutch Archiefschool</a> is conceptualizing along with colleagues at the <a href=""http://stadsarchief.breda.nl/"">Breda City Archives</a> (other institutions such as the <a href=""http://www.archief.nl/"">Dutch National Archives</a> and the <a href=""http://vrroom.naa.gov.au/"">National Archives of Australia</a> have also been working on this concept).

I also learned a bit more about the <a href=""http://www.divakoepel.nl/"">DIVA</a>-sponsored '<a href=""http://www.digitaalverleden.nl/en/home.php"">Digital Society of the Past</a>' project which is attempting to establish a peer-to-peer network of digital archival materials.

Both of these have given me some insight into how to conceptualize a model environment in which digital archival materials might be shared and organized as part of a mixed network of public and private archival collections.

I will post about this over the coming weeks as I begin to prepare the presentations that I will make on my research thus far (namely, <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/28/archives-access-systems/"">archives access systems</a> and <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/10/what-is-web-20/"">Web 2.0 technologies and practices</a>) at three upcoming conferences (<a href=""http://www.imaging.org/conferences/archiving2006/"">IS&T Archiving 2006</a>, <a href=""http://archivists.ca/conference/default.aspx"">ACA 2006</a>, <a href=""http://archivists.org/conference/dc2006/index.asp"">SAA 2006</a>).","I shall blog!","0",,"publish","open","open",,"i-shall-blog",,,"2006-04-27 15:50:03","2006-04-27 23:50:03",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=40","0","post",,"0"

I'm going to be talking about Web 2.0 as a set of enabling technologies and practices that can enhance the quality of <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/28/archives-access-systems/"">archives access systems</a>.

Of course, ""Web 2.0"" is a hodge-podge of intersecting technologies, ideas, practices and marketing pitches. It has gotten a lot of attention over the past year in the tech press and geek blogosphere but you know it has hit maintstream when the term starts showing up in airline in-flight magazines (see AirCanada's <a href=""http://www.enroutemag.com/e/may06/feature_a.html""><em>EnRoute</em></a> (May 2006)).

Although the ""Web 2.0"" term probably has a limited shelf life, I expect it will at least get people's attention as they scan a conference program.  It provides a relatively wide and hype-charged entry-point for a discussion on some of the more interesting of the new web technologies and practices.

For the purpose of my presentation, I have focussed on three core Web 2.0 themes:
<ol>
	<li>usability</li>
	<li>openness</li>
	<li>community</li>
</ol>

<!--more-->

<h2>Usability</h2>
As part of the usability theme I intend to discuss AJAX features such as auto-complete, drag-n-drop, and dynamic update of page components without reload as well as other Web 2.0-like usability improvements such as permalinks, feed aggregators, personalization, and the use of simple, functional design (with generous application of whitespace and what appears to be a preference for <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/stabilo-boss/93136022/"">neon-green logos</a>). All of these elements can be incorporated into existing and new archives access systems to improve their usability.

<h2>Openness</h2>
When I say ""openness"" I am actually trying to refer to four key charateristics of the Web 2.0 trend:<ol>
	<li>open architectures</li>
       <li>open standards</li>
        <li>open content</li>
        <li>open source</li>

</ol>

Open architectures refers to the 'web as platform' concept that encourages the use of loosely-coupled components, web services and APIs to piece together application functionality or content 'mash-ups'. Open architectures are enabled by the use of open standards such as (URI, HTTP, XML, XHTML, CSS, Atom, etc.)

Open architectures and standards have lots of implications for the archives community as common services (e.g. archival description, subject classification, search, reference and research) might be shared between institutions at both the technical and program/service delivery levels. Likewise, loosely-coupled components can be used to improve the ongoing management of enterprise information systems, freeing the institution from being dependent on one behemoth, technology stack.

Up until now, we've only seen limited use of open architecture and technical standard concepts in archives management systems, namely as EAD finding aids and OAI-PMH harvesting.

However, there are plenty of Web2.0 type technologies and standards that can enhance archives system architectures. For example, the use of simple syndication feeds and pings, particularly through the IETF's newly approved <a href=""http://www.atomenabled.org/"">Atom 1.0</a> standard, can greatly improve upon the 'harvesting' concept, including the potential to distribute not just metadata but also digital objects as Atom 1.0 supports base64-encoded binary content.

Also, geo-coding archival materials with latitude and longtitude information (related to the place of creation, use, custody, or the location of related materials) allows for integration with map-based browsing and access tools or as input to the growing variety of wifi location-based services such as walking-tours and GPS treasure hunts.

Open content and open access refer to the elminination of restrictions on the re-use of digital information through more flexible licensing practices such as those provided through Creative Commons licenses as well as the increased sharing of content on sites such as <a href=""http://flickr.com"">Flickr.com</a> and <a href=""http://ourmedia.org"">OurMedia.org</a>.

Although there are still many tough legal, business, and professional obstacles to clear, the increased adoptation of open content licensing can help archival institutions to enrich the content and contextual information of their own collections (e.g. by syndicating metadata and/or content from other collections that complement their own). More significantly, opening up collections (e.g. as proposed by the <a href=""http://www.opencontentalliance.org/"">Open Content Alliance</a>) will 'let a million flowers bloom' and enrich the 'long tail' of the Web with the wealth of unique information and cultural treasures that are preserved in archival collections.

Lastly, as institutions with limited funding that are managing public information as part of the public trust, archives can only benefit from using and supporting open source software to manage their functions, programs and websites. Fortunately, the leading <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/01/21/drupal-as-a-mvc-framework#MVC"">Model-View-Controller</a> (MVC) frameworks that are being used to build most of the new Web 2.0 applications are all open-source products (e.g. RubyOnRails, Django, TurboGears, Symfony) and they all run on open-source server architectures (e.g. Linux, Apache, MySQL).

<h2>Community</h2>
Aside from the technological innovations of Web 2.0, the most distinguishing characteristic of this trend has to be importance of nurturing a community around a given online service, technology or content repository. That is to say, a community in the sense of people connecting to other people but also a community that takes responsibility and ownership of the services, technology and content. Some poster children of this trend include <a href=""http://wikipedia.org"">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/"">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=""http://myspace.com/"">MySpace</a>. Some buzzwords associated with this trend include social software, radical trust, decentralization, and disintermediation.

'Disintermediation' is a mouthful of a buzzword that was actually introduced in the last wave of web hype (i.e. the dot-Com boom). It refers to the concept of cutting out the middleman and, although ordering your next pet online never really took off, disintermediation does refer to a trend that is continuing today. The most recent example that has been getting a lot of attention is <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/start.html?pg=2"">grassroots journalism</a> wherein everyday people are posting their own reports, analysis, pictures and videos of events to their own blogs or community-operated news portals (e.g. <a href=""http://nowpublic.com"">NowPublic.com</a>). These grassroots journalists are giving new insight, context and emperical information that corrects, verifies or enhances the reports provided by the traditional news outlets or, in many cases, providing coverage of events that the traditional media has ignored.

Similarly, archival institutions are going to have to accept the rise of grassroots archivists. Not as barbarians at the city gates but as value-adding partners that share the goal of preserving historical memories and experiences. In his excellent webcast presentation, <em><a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/03/10/are-archives-doomed/"">Are the Archives Doomed?</a></em>, Rick Prelinger discusses the emergence of what he calls 'archives groupies' and the wonderful, often unexpected results that occur when users are invited to participate in the organization and use of archival collections.

Some interesting early examples of how these Web 2.0 concepts could be applied to archival collections include:

<h2>Archival Institutions and Web 2.0</h2>

I assume, of course, that professional archivists will have issues with blurring the lines between institutionally managed archival materials and descriptions and those contributed, enhanced or re-used by patrons. Copyright and restrictive access conditions placed on material by donors are a concern. Another legitimate concern would be to protect the authenticity of archival materials and the context of their original creation and use.

I therefore see the introduction of community-managed collections, descriptions, exhibits and discussions as something that happens in parallel to the authoritative archives access systems that are managed by archival institutions and their professional staff. I see these parallel systems as taking the form of virtual collections or virtual research rooms that are loosely-coupled to the institutional systems using open architectures and standards.

These could exist completely seperate from the institution, on another organization's technology platform, but I also think that archival institutions stand to benefit from taking a leadership role in encouraging new and innovative use of their collections and being the benefactor and host of new, online communities. Web 2.0 is full of interesting stories and lessons of how that might be accomplished.</p>","Web 2.0 and Archival Institutions","0",,"publish","open","open",,"web-20-and-archival-institutions",,,"2006-05-08 15:53:36","2006-05-08 23:53:36",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=41","0","post",,"6"

I gave a high-speed rant of a presentation yesterday about 'Web 2.0 and Access to Digital Archives'. A day later, other presenters are still promising the audience that they won't 'talk as fast as Peter.' I've posted a slower version of <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/shockwave-flash/ACA2006.html"">the presentation as a webcast</a>.

The IS&T Archiving conference has, in the short span of three years, quietly become the de-facto digital preservation conference that brings together an interesting blend of academics, vendors and memory institutions. Digital preservation luminaries like Clifford Lynch and Howard Besser consider it worth their time, although both have been pounding away on their laptop keyboards since the conference began.
<!--more-->
Part of the appeal of the IS&T Archiving conference is that the presentations are less about the theory of digital archiving and more about the technical details of what has been done or is about to be done in practice. There is also a single stream of presentations so, firstly, you don't have to choose between different presentation tracks and, secondly, it allows for some cross-polination of interests and expertise, this is especially noticeable during the question and feedback sessions. The interactive poster session is also intended for more casual, two-way communication about digital archiving ideas and practices.

<h2>National Archivist with a Web 2.0 vision</h2>
The keynote presentation for the conference was given by Ian Wilson, Canada's National Librarian and Archivist. His talk was an excellent segue into my own presentation because he spoke about the very inspiring vision of the Library and Archives of Canada to make more of its holdings available online, to integrate it with other collections and services, to promote its use and re-use, and the importance of encouraging end-users to find new ways to apply and enhance the information and knowledge that is contained in the archival materials. When I asked him about the challenge that copyright poses to the vision of opening and sharing content in archival collections, he proposed looking into some type of micropayment incentive system to persuade copyright holders to loosen the restrictions on the access and use of their content. It was very refreshing to hear our national archivist talk about providing access to our documentary heritage in new and innovative ways.

<h2>Highlights</h2>
I am typing this at mid-day of day 2 of the conference but the sessions I have seen already and the people I have talked to thus far has already made this trip worthwhile. Right now Richard Marciano is talking about the WRAP Project's preservation of large-scale multimedia collections. Some of the other highlights include presentations on Microsoft's emperical research project studying how people manage their personal digital archives (i.e. they don't), the emulator prototype at the National Archives of the Netherlands, the short history of digital archiving, and the Library of Congress work on creating a bottom-up object model framework for digital repositories. They are looking at managing the myriad of relationships in a given digital repostiory as seperate RDF-triplicate style objects which is exactly the design I intend to incorporate into the data model for the <a href=""http://osaris-project.org"">OSARIS-project software</a> I will be working on this summer.

The presentation on the U.S. National Archives' Electronic Records Archives (ERA) project was, unfortunately, characterized by the limited amount of information that the speaker was able to give about the details of the system itself (i.e. if we told you how our security architecture is designed, we'd have to shoot you).

<h2>OAIS is spoken here</h2>
Lastly, it looks like <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/08/digital-archives/#oais"">OAIS</a> is becoming the <em>lingua franca</em> of digital preservationists. Presenters don't feel the need to explain OAIS diagrams or terms, they are just used as general reference points in a wide range of discussions. That's exactly the point and goal of a reference model.","IS&#038;T Archiving 2006","0",,"publish","open","open",,"ist-archiving-2006",,,"2006-05-25 10:12:23","2006-05-25 18:12:23",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=43","0","post",,"0"

In the meanwhile, Professor Beth Yakel and a group of grad students at the University of Michigan's School of Information have already launched an excellent prototype system to experiment with these concepts.

The <a href=""http://polarbears.si.umich.edu/index.pl?lastnode_id=272&node_id=272"">Polar Bear Expedition Digital Collections</a> website is an innovative access aid to over sixty digitized collections of primary and published material dealing with a U.S. military intervention in northern Russia at the end of World War I. The goal of the project is 'to expand the capability of <a href=""http://www.archivists.org/glossary/term_details.asp?DefinitionKey=1636"">EAD</a>, make the archival and research experience collaborative and participatory, and challenge the traditional finding aid structure.'<!--more-->

The two most notable Web 2.0 features are commenting and recommendations. The researcher is able to add comments to individual archival materials as well as to communicate with 'The Archivist' and fellow researchers. The recommendation feature logs link paths used by researchers and provides a ""Researchers who viewed this page also viewed"" list.

On the back-end, the project is developing ways to mark up and extract related terms and concepts to enhance the browse capability of the access aid. They also intend to add keyword tagging soon.

The site has been up and running since January 2006 and the project has been able to study some of the implications of enhanced archives access systems for archivists and archival best practices. Even though there are now multiple pathways to the items in the collections, they continue to be organized in accordance with the principle of original order, most simply with 'previous' and 'next' navigation between items in files. The principle of provenance is also respected by maintaining the collections as the predominate top-level structure.

Professor Yakel observes that the role of the reference archivist in a multi-featured archives access system has been changed but not diminshed. Users continue to require the assistance of reference archivists in navigating through the collections and identifying relevant materials. This advice is now given predominantly through electronic means such as the commenting feature. Yakel also predicts that reference archivists will have to devote more time to producing and maintaining such commonly expected website features as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), help pages and online tutorials.

The codename for the project and software is ICA-AtoM, which is an acronymn for <strong>International Council on Archives - Access to Memory</strong>.

The <a href=""http://www.ica.org/"">International Council on Archives</a> (ICA) is the project sponsor. I am managing the software development through my consulting company <a href=""http://www.artefactual.com/"">Artefactual Systems</a> in collaboration with the <a href=""http://www.archiefschool.nl/"">Dutch Archiefschool</a> and their research coordinator Peter Horsman (also one of my PhD supervisors).
<!--more-->

<h2>Guide to Archival Sources on Human Rights Violations</h2>
The impetus for the ICA-AtoM software project is another ICA project. The ICA Archives and Human Rights working group received funding recently from UNESCO to create a searchable, online guide to international archival sources on human rights violations. The goal of this Guide is to enable users to identify archival materials relating to a particular human rights event or topic, locate the country and repository in which the archival materials are held, and determine the conditions for access to these documents.

One of UNESCO and the ICA's requirements was that any software produced as part of the Guide project should be made available under an open source license. At its core, this Guide will require a basic web-based archival description application. It makes sense, therefore, to leverage the work done on the Guide website and software as the first step in creating a generic archival description application that can be made available to the archival community as a whole.

The core application requirements will be based on the ICA standard's for archival description (ISAD(G)) and archival authorities (ISAAR(CPF)) as well as the OSARIS functional requirements which were drafted in 2003 by the ICA Committee on Information Technology.

<h2>ICA-AtoM Development Roadmap</h2>
The first phase of the ICA-AtoM project is the development of the website and software to host the Guide to Archival Sources on Human Rights Violations. The first beta release of this website is due in Fall 2006. The second phase will be to extract the archival description and retrieval component of the Guide software and make it available as the first core version of the ICA-AtoM open source software. The future requirements of the ICA-AtoM software will be accounted for as the Guide website is designed and developed.

The Guide website is located at: <a href=""http://humanrightsarchives.org"">http://humanrightsarchives.org</a>
The ICA-AtoM website is located at: <a href=""http://ica-atom.org"">http://ica-atom.org</a>

Discussions are already under way to add additional modules to the core archival description application to provide functionality and features such as digital repository interfaces, accessioning workflow, physical box management, reference room management, etc..

Of course, any further development will be dependent on a combination of securing additional funding and generating enough interest and support in the project from the archival community and other developers who are interested in contributing to the application's codebase. The ICA-AtoM application will likely be released under a GPL open source license.

<h2>ICA-AtoM Technical Architecture</h2>
On this blog I have been posting about my evaluation of several options  (RubyOnRails, Django, Drupal, Greenstone, Fedora) for building the Guide and ICA-AtoM as a web-based application (see the posts under the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/category/system-architecture/"">Systems Architecture</a> category). In the end we've selected the <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/content/about.html"">Symfony</a> PHP5 MVC framework as the development platform for a number of reasons including; the breadth of MVC features and functionality that Symfony incorporates, the extensive internationalization support, the ubiquity of PHP servers and developers, the richest set of online documentation of any of the MVC frameworks, and the very active and supportive community of Symfony developers and users.

The Model, View, Controller (MVC) design pattern is the current best practice for architecting web applications. A MVC architecture seperates a web application into three primary layers. The Model layers abstracts a domain-specific data model and interacts with the data persistence layer on its behalf (usually a database but could also be XML or text files). The Controller interacts with the user through an interface (e.g. a webpage). The Controller receives information or requests from the user, routes these to the appropriate place in the application and returns the application’s response to the user. The View layer adds presentation templates (e.g. styles, themes, etc.) to the data that comes from the model layer, before it is sent back to the user interface by the Controller.

MVC architectures improve the development, scalability and on-going maintenance of web applications by dividing their critical components into seperate layers that can be enhanced or exchanged without affecting the other layers. Essentially, the MVC pattern follows the long-established software engineering paradigm of seperating data persistence from application logic from presentation.","ICA-AtoM: open source software for archives","0",,"publish","open","open",,"ica-atom-open-source-software-for-archives",,,"2006-06-20 06:27:04","2006-06-20 14:27:04",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=45","0","post",,"2"

I was expecting some objections to the ideas that I was putting forth on the basis of protecting professional standards, preserving authentic context or budget priorities. However, my talk was well-received and I only had discussions with archivists who are very keen on applying the Web 2.0 concepts of open architectures, open content and community-input to their collections.

I have posted a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/shockwave-flash/ACA2006.html"">screencast copy</a> of my ACA 2006 presentation in the 'Papers & Presentations' section of my blog.","ACA 2006","0",,"publish","open","open",,"aca-2006",,,"2006-07-03 05:55:27","2006-07-03 13:55:27",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/2006/07/03/aca-2006/","0","post",,"0"

In this book, Morville studies the latest Web trends and technologies from the perspective of findability, which he defines as the “the degree to which a particular object is easy to discover or locate.” He notes that the Web is changing how we live, work and interact with each other and that the findability of information on the web has a profound impact on who we are and who we will become.

Ambient Findability provides a timely overview of information retrieval and its role and relationship to the Web. I was familiar with many of references and concepts but the book does an excellent job of acting as a “boundary object” for these various ideas and practices while stringing them together into a cohesive and very readable narrative.

A number of the discussions in the book are applicable to <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/10/27/research-topi/"">my research</a> into web-based archives access systems. I have summarized the most relevant in a list called, <strong>10 Ideas I Found in Ambient Findability</strong>:

1. The Web is about human cooperation
2. The Noosphere is real…dude.
3. Information flows through us, and changes us
4. This is your brain on information overload
5. Too much is not enough is too much
6. Ignoring ignorance is bliss
7. Information systems are not irrational enough
8. Words, Meaning and Scale: The problem with Information Retrieval
9. A Folksonomy Is Better than No-onomy
10. Semantic Web and Web 2.0 Are Not Mutually Exclusive
<!--more-->

Of course, this list is no substitute for the book itself. As Morville himself might say, the genre of the paper-bound book will affect how you experience the content he has written. If you are at all interested in information retrieval and the future of the Web you should <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ambient/"">get yourself a copy of this book</a>.

<h2>1. The Web is about human cooperation</h2>
In the year 2000, David Weinberger wrote in his book <em>Cluetrain Manifesto</em>: “We don’t know what the Web is for but we’ve adopted it faster than any technology since fire.”

Five years later, Morville concludes that, at its core, the Web is about human cooperation and it is hard to argue with that assessment given the explosion of social software and online community building.

Morville quotes a blog comment by Michael Pusateri: “The change isn’t occurring in software, it’s occurring in people’s minds. Finally the guy who loves to make wooden ships in the bottle is realizing there’s a ton of other ship builders out there and some of them live in his town.” (p.135).

Communication is the backbone of all human society and the Web is one big conversation.

<h2>2. The Noosphere is real…dude.</h2>
 “A Jesuit palaeontologist and philosopher by the name of Teilhard de Chardin popularized the notion of the noosphere or “sphere of human thought” back in the early 1900s. Similar to the atmosphere and biosphere, the noosphere is composed of all the interacting minds and ideas on earth.” (p33)

The information we find and the activities we participate in on the Web have a very real effect on our daily lives. Cyberspace, the noosphere, are not virtual. They are real.

(p42) “When we talk about navigating the noosphere and wayfinding on the Web, we are not just using metaphor. The worlds of words and ideas are in a very real sense, real. When we enter these spaces, we bring our senses along for the ride. We rely on geocentric and egocentric strategies that have served us for millennia. We become disoriented. We get lost. We find our way. We learn. Our virtual experience change us physically.”

<h2>3. Information flows through us, and changes us</h2>
 “Most of our knowledge is pushed at us by the highly personalized mix of influences that composes our surrounding environment: People…Organizations…Geography…Media… Every day, we are exposed to stories, news, images, songs, billboards, presentations, speeches, jokes, warnings, analysis, opinion and advice. As these messages and experiences flow through our doors of perception, they leave us with fragments of memory and insight.

As the Greek philosopher Heraclitus once noted, ‘No man every steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river, and he is not the same man.’”
(pp116-117)

<h2>4. This is your brain on information overload</h2>
 “a recent study at King’s College in London showed that information overload harms concentration more than marijuana.” (p165)

 “information and decision overload induces stress-related problems while simultaneously reducing our ability to identify and manage root causes.” (p166)

 “It’s time we shifted our focus from creating a wealth of information to addressing the ensuing poverty of attention.” (pp44-45)

<h2>5. Too much is not enough is too much</h2>
 “Because our trust in authority has eroded, we must find our own solutions. We select our sources. We choose our news. But since we’re swimming in information our decision quality is poor. So, how do we stop from drowning? We fall back on instinct. We retreat from data. We drop pull and endure push. We pay attention only to messages that find us. And when we do search, we skim. A keyword or two into Google, a few good hits, and we’re done. We satisfice with reckless abandon, waffling back and forth between too much information and not enough. And, we make some very bad decisions as individuals, organizations and societies.” (p166)

<h2>6. Ignoring ignorance is bliss</h2>
It turns out there’s another Moore’s law. The most well know law is attributed to Intel founder Gordon Moore in 1965. It states that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits will double every year.

The other Moore’s law is actually spelled Mooers’ law and, in many ways, I find it even more interesting than its better know homonym. In 1959, Calvin Mooers stated that “An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it.’  Sometime we don’t want new information, he argued – less is more.” (p44)

Mooer’s Law hits on a fundamental characteristic of how human’s interact with information. It’s true, many times I deliberately don’t search for information because the answer might be inconvenient, cause worry, or lead only to more work and investigation. Ignorance is bliss. Or rather, ignoring ignorance is bliss.

<h2>7. Information systems are not irrational enough</h2>
The missing link between Human Computer Interface and Systems Design is the fact that “human behaviour is often not rational or optimal.”(p55)

Information systems should adapt or account for the fact that:
<ul>
	<li>Humans often categorize things using fuzzy cognitive models, emotions, and wishful thinking rather than objective rules</li>

	<li>Humans will always expend the least effort if they can get away with it. There’s almost no difference between something being a bit of an effort and it being impossible because we’ll quit or find a work-around before we complete the task.</li>

	<li>Humans want to be happy. Pretty things make them happy. Compliments make them happy, even if it comes from pre-programmed code.</li>

	<li>Humans want to trust. Ugly interfaces, slow response, poor findability breeds mistrust.</li>

	<li>Information seeking is more like picking berries than hunting elephants.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>8. Words, Meaning and Scale: The problem with Information Retrieval</h2>
 “Words intended to represent concepts: that is the questionable foundation upon which information retrieval is built. Words in the content. Words in the query. Even collections of images and software and physical objects rely on words in the form of metadata for representation and retrieval. And words are imprecise, ambiguous, indeterminate, vague, opaque” (p51)

 “Controlled vocabularies help retrieval systems to manage the challenges of ambiguity and meaning inherent in language. And they become increasingly valuable as systems grow larger. Unfortunately, centralized manual tagging efforts also become prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for most large-scale applications. So they often can’t be used where they’re needed the most.” (p53)

 “This is the paradox of ambient findability. As information volume increases, our ability to find any particular item decreases. We’re staring down the barrel of the biggest vocabulary control challenge imaginable, and we can’t stop adding powder.” (p86)

<h2>9. A Folksonomy Is Better than No-onomy</h2>
In a folksonomy, “users tag objects with keywords, with the option of multiple tags…The tags are shared and become pivots for social navigation. Users can move fluidly between objects, tags, authors, and indexers. Things get interesting when many people apply different tags to the same object and when many people apply the same tag to different objects.” (pp136-137)

Anyone who uses tags created by others on a website such as Flickr or Del.icio.us (i.e. clicks on one to find information or uses an existing, 'popular' tag  on a new object) is relying on the ‘wisdom of the crowd’; the idea that groups of humans can exhibit a kind of collective intelligence, when they are connected and communicating in the right ways. This is one way to deal with the information retrieval problem of words, meaning and scale.

Morville warns that there’s fine line between the ‘wisdom of crowds’ and the ‘madness of mobs'. At the same time, he quotes Clay Shirky who makes the very valid point that “the advantage of folksonomies isn’t that they’re better than controlled vocabularies, it’s that they’re better than nothing, because controlled vocabularies are not extensible to the majority of cases, where tagging is needed.”

<h2>10. Semantic Web and Web 2.0 Are Not Mutually Exclusive</h2>
So is there a way out of this mess? Clay Shirky is most renowned for arguing that the Semantic Web is an unrealistic waste of time. Most Web 2.0 practitioners seem to agree, if not in words, certainly with their actions. Semantic Web is a vision for self-describing information entities and relationships that relies upon systematically applied and structured metadata such as Dublin Core and RDF. However, even though this vision has been around for a number of years, there is a scarcity of applications and websites that have incorporated it. For the Semantic Web to work, it needs widespread participation.

Nevertheless, Morville argues, and I agree, that the “Semantic Web tools and standards [will, eventually] create a powerful, enduring foundation [for an unifying, universal information architecture]. Taxonomies and ontologies provide a solid semantic network that connects interface to infrastructure. And the fast-moving, fashionable folksonomies sit on top: flexible, adaptable, and responsive to user feedback.” (p141)

 “Over time, the lessons learned at the top [layer of the unifying information architecture] are passed down, embedded into the more enduring layers of social and semantic infrastructure. This is the future of findability and sociosemantic navigation: a rich tapestry of words and code that builds upon the strange connections between people and content and metadata.” (p141)

<h2>Digital Preservation</h2>
There were some very informative sessions on digital preservation initiatives including the RLG/NARA Audit Checklist for Certifying Trusted Digital Repositories, PREMIS preservation metadata, the Dspace digital repository, the European PLANETS collaboration and finally some more detail and background on the U.S. NARA multi-million dollar Electronic Records Archives (ERA) project.

One interesting thing I learned from talking to the ERA project director, Ken Thibodeau, is that the ERA is more of a service-oriented architecture that integrates a number of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications with open source utilities, rather than one single mammoth application that is being written from scratch by prime contractor Lockheed Martin.

I also learned from Reagan Moore, director of the San Diego Supercomputing Centre's Storage Resource Broker (SRB) project, that the SRB datagrid technology is being completely re-written from scratch to allow its release, sometime next year, as a fully open source platform.

<h2>Open Source Software</h2>
Speaking of open-source, I was especially interested to learn more about two open-source archives applications that have recently cropped up. Namely, because my current consulting project is to develop <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/06/20/ica-atom-open-source-software-for-archives/"">ICA-AtoM</a>, an open-source  archival description application for the International Council on Archives. I will post more about these other two projects tomorrow...","SAA 2006 Annual Conference","0",,"publish","open","open",,"saa-2006-annual-conference",,,"2006-08-06 13:49:28","2006-08-06 21:49:28",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=48","0","post",,"1"
"41","2","2006-08-07 07:06:06","2006-08-07 15:06:06","In a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/06/20/ica-atom-open-source-software-for-archives/"">previous post</a>, I announced that the consulting project that I am working on this summer is the development of ICA-AtoM, an open-source archival description application for the International Council on Archives. In the meanwhile, two other open-source archives application projects have recently cropped up.

For the past 8 years or so, I have been talking with colleagues and clients about how a decent open-source archives application was sorely lacking in the archives community. Then within the span of half a year, there are suddenly three projects!

Although I had begun to hear about both of these other projects over the past few months, the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/08/06/saa-2006-annual-conference/"">SAA conference</a> in Washington, DC last week was the first opportunity to learn more about these projects, meet the developers and see demos of their applications. <!--more-->

The first project is <a href=""http://archonproject.org/"">Archon</a> which, like ICA-AtoM, is also developed as a web-based application using PHP5. Their target community is university archives as well as the so-called 'lone arrangers' working in small repositories with limited professional capacity and resources. The second project is <a href=""http://archiviststoolkit.org/"">Archivists' Toolkit</a> which is a desktop application developed in Java.

Archon has been made available for public release (under an academic and research license) just in time for the SAA conference. The Archivists' Toolkit expects to deliver its first public release in December 2006.

Although there is overlap between the two applications, I would characterize Archon as being more focused on allowing its users to get finding aids online and Archivists' Toolkit as an application to assist archivists in the internal processing of archival collections.

Both Archon and Archivists' Toolkit are based internally on an Encoded Archival Description (EAD) structure, although they do a nice job of hiding the technical markup complexity from the user by allowing for data-entry via standard forms and the automatic tagging, import and export of EAD data.

Of course, an important consideration in the open source community is not to duplicate or split effort. Nevertheless, at this time, I don't think that either of these applications is suitable as a replacement or a new foundation on which to build the ICA-AtoM application, given the ICA's requirements and timeline.

Firstly, ICA-AtoM and the <a href=""http://humanrightsarchives.org/"">Guide to Archival Sources on Human Rights Violations</a> website (that needs to be delivered very shortly using ICA-AtoM) must be fully web-based applications. This rules out Archivists' Toolkit. Secondly, ICA-AtoM needs to be based on the ICA-ISAD(G) and ICA-ISAAR(CPF) standards as its core structure (although EAD import and export will also be a key feature).

Most importantly, ICA-AtoM must be a fully internationalized application that allows for multiple translations of both the application interface and the application content in any language or script. This requires that i18n (developer shorthand for 'internationalization') needs to be built into the core of the application. The <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/content/about.html"">Symfony MVC platform</a> on which I am developing the ICA-AtoM application has i18n hooks built in. On top of that, the Symfony platform provides a best-practice framework that is based on proven design patterns for web applications. This platform provides an additional layer of abstraction, rich documentation and an already existing developer community on which the ICA-AtoM application can be supported and enhanced going forward

At the same time, I expect and hope that these three projects can identify their respective niche and strengths over the coming year and allow for integration and overlap where that is feasible (e.g. using a plug-in architecture to share modules or using ICA-AtoM as a web interface to the Archivists' Toolkit application). It's too early in the development cycle for each of these three projects to be clear on what this would look like going forward.

I did manage to talk about this briefly with members of both project teams and everyone does seem supportive of the respective efforts and expressed a desire to talk in more detail at some point in the near future about the relationship between these exciting and much-needed projects.","More Open Source Software for Archives","0",,"publish","open","open",,"more-open-source-software-for-archives",,,"2006-08-07 07:06:06","2006-08-07 15:06:06",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=49","0","post",,"4"

A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_camp"">BarCamp</a> is an open, participatory workshop-event, where the meeting logistics and the tech-oriented content are organized collaboratively by the attendees. BarCamp Vancouver was part of the worldwide BarCampEarth, a series of simultaneous BarCamps taking place around the world between August 25-27, 2006.

<p>I sat in on some great sessions on Search Engine Optimization, Digital Identity, User Authentication, Social Music Services, Tagging, Improving Presentations and Tech Activism. I think the most representative photo of all the shots that are now <a href=""http://flickr.com/search/?q=barcamp+vancouver&z=t"">posted over at Flickr</a> is the one above (taken by John Bollwit who has some good session summaries over on his <a href=""http://audihertz.net/blog/category/barcampvancouver/"">Audihertz.net</a> blog).

I love the Vancouver tech community!</p><!--more-->

<p><img src='/wp-content/images/barcampvan-sched.jpg' align='left' style='margin-right: 3px;' />In true ad-hoc BarCamp style, I changed the topic of my own presentation during the morning scheduling session, when we organized the conference schedule on the spot using yellow sticky-notes. I had intended to talk about the Symfony MVC PHP5 platform that I am using right now to develop the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/06/20/ica-atom-open-source-software-for-archives/"">ICA-AtoM</a> open source archives management package. However, during the Friday evening BarCamp social, I spent a lot of time talking to people about <a href=""http://artefactual.com/about.htm"">the work I do</a> as a digital archives consultant.

I had forgotten that the long-term accessibility and usability of digital content is still a concern to the tech-savvy as well. So at the last minute I decided to wing-it and threw together a quick rant on digital archiving which, by now, I can (and probably do) in my sleep. Of course, I mentioned the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/08/digital-archives/#oais"">OAIS reference model</a> concepts as a starting point and put in a plug for the European <a href=""http://www.casparpreserves.eu/"">CASPAR</a> digital preservation community, which is taking an open, collaborative approach to the digital preservation problem. Of particular interest is their goal to facilitate the creation and use of inter-operable digital archiving components using existing and new protocols, tools and platforms.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a whirlwind 24 hours. Made especially interesting as I was obsessively debugging my ICA-AtoM application while sitting in on sessions and chatting with other attendees. I was especially interested to hear from <a href=""http://www.bryght.com/"">Bryght</a>'s James Walker and Boris Mann about the progress that has been made with Drupal's CCK and Views modules since I last <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/01/21/drupal-as-a-mvc-framework/"">investigated Drupal</a> as a platform option for ICA-AtoM. This now gives Drupal the ability to define custom domain models which, along with the poorly organized documentation, was the main reason I did not choose to use Drupal for my project initially.

Given the problem I was having on the weekend with a<a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/forum/index.php/t/2740/""> dumb-founding user session error</a>, I came very close to picking up Drupal again to give it another whirl. It's hard to resist Boris' evangelical zeal for attracting converts into the Drupal fold. One of the main draws is the large community of Drupal implementors and developers who continue to pump out great websites and new Drupal functionality (e.g. an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261"">Amazon S3</a> interface). There is just a great economy of scale in the Drupal community which can be put to good use if you're willing to handle a little clutter in your application architecture and a little confusion in your documentation.

Anyway, I did manage to resolve my user session error (of course, it was Microsoft's fault. Internet Explorer doesn't allow servers with underscores '_'  in their title even though I am just running the virtual server locally on my development machine). So I am back, full-steam ahead with developing ICA-AtoM on <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/content/about.html"">Symfony</a> today. Other than the odd hickup here and there I have to say that I am extremely pleased with Symfony's simplicity, flexibility and power, not to mention the excellent documentation which will soon be complemented with an <a href=""http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10222"">Apress published book</a>.

Nevertheless, I will be closely following Mark Jordan's prototyping of <a href=""http://digitizationblog.interoperating.info/?p=327"">Drupal as a digital repository</a> and hope to find some time shortly to test-drive the new Drupal CCK & Views modules myself...because if I don't, Boris Mann will hunt me down and beat me with a left-over BarCamp BBQ smokie!

Therefore, I think it will be no surprise if we start seeing a lot of map-based mashups in the archives and digital history community over the next year or so.

I have spoken to a few colleagues in the past few months who are interested in prototyping some map mashups.

One archives software vendor has <a href=""http://www.eloquent-systems.com/aboutus/news_20060726_2.shtml"">announced Google maps integration</a> as a product feature, although I have not been able to find an online working example of it.

I am also curious how that affects the Google policy on commercial services using the Googlemaps API.

At the SAA conference in Washington last month, Dan Cohen demonstrated a great map mashup of the <a href=""http://www.911digitalarchive.org/maps/ground_zero.php"">September 11 digital archive</a>


http://www.mapyourancestors.com/

Based on these early developments,
the relative ease using map service APIs
the accessibility, universality of maps. People like maps:

I think we will begin to see maps as a viable, graphic alternative to traditional text-based search and browse interfaces for archives access systems.

Issues.

1)geo-coding

latitute and longtitude should become standard metadata elements in archival descriptions, authority files, repository profiles, even subject thesauri when these refer to places and events



2)historical place names

This version of the ICA-AtoM software is being used to manage a preview release of the <a href=""http://humanrightsarchives.org"">HumanRightsArchives.org</a> website which hosts a searchable guide to archival sources related to human rights violations.

The alpha release provides basic archival description, search, browse and website management features (menus, user accounts, static page editing). The archival description component is fully compliant with the International Council on Archives' standards for archival description (<a href=""http://www.ica.org/biblio.php?pdocid=1"">ICA-ISAD(G)</a>), archival authority records (<a href=""http://www.ica.org/biblio.php?pdocid=144"">ICA-ISAAR(CPF)</a>) and the forthcoming standard for institutions with archival holdings (ICA-ISIAH). The subject access points are populated with terms from the UNESCO Subject Thesaurus.

This is a very early alpha release and therefore it is subject to any unforeseen hicups and it is still limited in features. However, I am pleased with the performance and flexiblity of the open-source software stack (MySQL, Apache, PHP5, Symfony MVC) and I am very optimistic about the ongoing enhancement of this software with new modules and features over the coming months.

If you believe Techorati.com, there are at least 50 million active blogs sending their feeds of chatter, anecdotes, thoughts, ideas, insight, news, gossip and otherwise mindless drivel into the cyberspace black hole. Everyone has one. My cat has one.

Anyway, I've been happy to claim my blog soapbox here at Archivemati.ca. It turns out that some people in the Long Tail of the InterWeb are actually interested in some of the same things I am. For the past six months I am averaging about 700-900 page downloads per day (of course a fair percentage of that is bots).

My most popular post by far is <em><a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/01/21/drupal-as-a-mvc-framework/"">Drupal as a MVC framework?</a></em>. It has received 5000 page downloads since it was first posted back in January 2006. It continues to get hits today. I suspect, though, that this says more about the lack of good Drupal architecture documentation than the quality of my article.

I started this blog as a way to organize my PhD research notes and links. However, the PhD is a part-time pursuit and I've got to pay the bills as a full-time consultant. Therefore, many of my recent posts have been related more to my consulting projects. Fortunately, the two are intentionally related.

I expect the ratio of consulting to research related posts to remain relative high so I recently changed the blog tagline to ""digital archives research and consulting"" (from ""researching access to digital archives"").

The blog has been a great way to let people know what I'm up to in my professional and academic life. I hope I can maintain it for at least another year.

Somebody is getting ready to prototype a digital archives at their archival institution and the first question they ask is, ""which open-source repository system should I use? <a href=""http://www.dspace.org/"">Dspace</a>? <a href=""http://fedora.info/"">Fedora</a>? <a href=""http://www.greenstone.org/"">Greenstone</a>? <a href=""http://www.eprints.org/"">Eprints</a>? ""

However, as a system analyst, I believe ""what are my requirements?"" is the more appropriate question to ask before selecting technology and tools.

In many instances these requirements might be much simpler, in a first iteration prototype, then what is offered by repository systems. Or worse, the repository system doesn't really support the necessary requirements and instead leads the implementors down a frustrating, time-consuming path of installing, configuring, tweaking, shoe-horning, customizing, re-designing, and re-integrating to meet the design constraints and quirks of the given repository system. All of which, in the end, is to meet some simple archival storage and/or metadata management requirements.
<!--more-->

<h2>First generation</h2>
The first generation of open-source repository platforms listed above were designed as 'institutional repository' or digital library systems. Their workflow and metadata functionality were hard-coded for e-text, e-thesis and e-library collections. This makes it slightly complicated to adapt them to the workflow and metadata requirements for digital collections of archival materials, i.e. records and other documentary materials that are managed using archival processes and principles (e.g. appraisal, accessioning, multi-level archival description).

Dspace from MIT has probably been getting the most attention from those that are pilot testing digital archives. I think in large part because it documents some of its architecture using OAIS terminology which speaks to archivists concerned about digital preservation (although comprehensive digital preservation support is something that is deferred to a future <a href=""http://wiki.dspace.org/index.php//DspaceTwo"">Dspace 2.0</a> release).

The other attraction is, of course, that is a fully open-source system. From my experience I have found that most archivists responsible for public records in the public trust prefer to work with open-source technology to keep their digital archive platforms as technically accessible and flexible as possible (even if that means passing on some more mature proprietary technologies).

However, as one MIT archivist admitted in a <a href=""http://www.archivists.org/conference/dc2006/dc2006prog-Session.asp?event=1721"">Dspace session</a> at the 2006 SAA conference, the current version of Dspace really isn't suited for use in an archival setting. The MIT Archives is instead planning their own customization of Dspace, called ""ASpace"" to adapt for use in an archival setting. I know of a couple of projects that started with Dspace as a prototype digital archives repository and abandoned it after deciding that working around the workflow and data management issues was going to be too much trouble.

That said, each of these systems, including Dspace, is now trying to become more flexible and allow for a service-based architecture. At the moment, however, I believe only Fedora is capable of opening its repository functionality as web services.

<h2>Java Content Repository (JCR) API</h2>
It would be great to see these institutional repository systems go one step further and provide support for the emerging industry standard JCR. JCR is a generic API for content repositories. It comes from the Java community but can be ported to any language. The current version is being worked on and supported by the who's who of the ECM and enterprise computing world (see list of names under Expert Group at the <a href=""http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283"">JCR project homepage</a>).

JCR API compliance would certainly open up the potential for open-source digital repositories in the enterprise (where we still have to fight an anti-open-source bias from most IT departments).  By the way, <a href=""http://jackrabbit.apache.org/index.html"">Apache JackRabbit</a> is an open-source digital repository system that does support JCR.

<h2>Don't get me wrong...</h2>
Anyway, this is not meant as a rant against the current batch of open-source repository systems, I hope they will improve to meet the needs of a wider user community (including JCR support). I expect to be using and supporting them well into the future as integral parts of mature digital archives architectures.

This post is meant more as a call for simplicity when starting a first iteration, simple digital archives prototype. It was inspired by a couple of articles I read recently.

<h2>Fedora and the Preservation of University Records Project</h2>
Firstly, the October 2006 RLG Diginews article that reported on the findings of the '<a href=""http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=20987&Printable=1&Article_ID=1855"">Fedora and the Preservation of University Records Project</a>'. This was a project that started very much along the usual lines, i.e. let's take Fedora and let's see what it will take to get it to work as our archival records repository. The authors note:

<blockquote>""We changed our focus when we realized that we were asking the wrong question. In serving as the repository core of a preservation system, a Fedora instance (or instances) would only be one part of an overall preservation environment. Large portions of ingest and access activities in addition to preservation planning decisions would occur outside of the Fedora instance...The question we should have asked was:'“Can a Fedora repository, surrounded by the proper preservation policies, tools, and Fedora services, serve as the basis of a trustworthy preservation system?'""</blockquote>

Their research project then shifted focus to produce an excellent set of <a href=""http://dca.tufts.edu/features/nhprc/index.html"">Ingest and Maintain (storage) guidelines</a>. In other words, it moved from the concept of a digital archives as a software application to the OAIS concept of an archival information system as a “an organization of people and systems that has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a designated community.”

<h2>The Internet Archive</h2>
Some archival professionals have been slightly annoyed with some of the thunder that was stolen from the digital archives community by the <a href=""http://www.archive.org/index.php"">Internet Archive</a> project which doesn't operate like a traditional archival institution but does publicize the word 'archive'. Anyway, turf wars about the term 'archive' is so 1990's; some of us don't even flinch anymore when techies use the word 'archival' as a noun instead of an adjective (e.g. 'email archival').

The point is that the Internet Archive is a great project that has managed to capture a legacy of digital content that would otherwise have been lost. As a result, the Internet Archive is now running the largest digital archives in the world. A recent <a href=""http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2054062,00.asp"">eWeek article</a> gave a behind the scenes look at the Internet Archive's technical architecture. What struck me was the simplicity of their setup:

<blockquote>""Despite the massive amounts of data that the Internet Archive is storing, managing and preserving for posterity, [Internet Archive founder Brewster] Kahle said the secret to the organization's success is keeping it simple.

""We don't do anything that isn't immediately obvious to college students with Linux on their dorm-room desktop,"" Kahle said. ""We are allergic to secret sauce. Everything we do is standardized and simple."" </blockquote>

The Internet Archive uses a JBOD (just a bunch of disks) approach. Off-the-shelf Ubuntu Linux boxes with four hard drives each, all networked together. Some basic network monitoring software, OAI metadata harvesting and off-site replication over HTTP and FTP. Simple. Scalable. Obvious to college students with Linux on their dorm-room desktop, or archivists converted into techies to deal with the changing (digital) nature of our collections.

<h2>A simple digital archives architecture</h2>
If that's good enough for the Internet Archive, which is handling petabytes of content and significant traffic volumes, why not for the first iteration of a simple digital archives prototype? Why shouldn't the 'archival storage' component of an OAIS not simply use a Linux or Windows OS to manage file storage rather than implement a digital repository system with all the technical architecture buy-in that requires?

As the Tuft-Yale Fedora Project concluded, it is really the supporting processes and tools around the archival storage that are critical anyway. These can be provided by procedural guidelines and simple utilities that can be mixed and matched, as best-of-breed solutions, to provide necessary functionality such as backup and replication, file normalization, checksum integrity monitoring, etc..

This would allow for the metadata and workflow components (e.g. OAIS' 'data management' and 'administration' components) to be managed in a simple database system that is tailored specifically for processing archival collections (e.g. such as the open-source <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/10/02/ica-atom-alpha-v01-release/"">ICA-AtoM application</a>, a custom database or a commercial archival description package). This database could enforce a simple namespace and use it to assign unique identifiers to the digital objects in archival storage, linking to a file or files on the network storage device(s). The database should, of course, be able to support both archival description standards and structural and technical metadata standards (e.g. PREMIS, METS). It would manage the physical and logical relationships between the digital objects, schedule and log preservation tasks, and provide search and browse access. It goes without saying of course, that maintaining the links between the database records and the digital objects would be a critical requirement.

Anyway, I can appreciate that such a database application would also get fairly complex. But it can be built from the ground up (like ICA-AtoM) as an archival description application that supports multi-level archival description, archival authority files, and archival processing workflows, therefore making it easier to integrate into an existing archival institution setting.

I can also appreciate that the archivist responsible for this prototype would have to acquire new technical skills to implement and manage it but this would still be a requirement even if an existing repository system was being used. This way, however, the archivist gets a thorough understanding of how all the pieces fit together, allowing them to retool the components as necessary, rather than working with what may otherwise appear to be a mysterious black box.

Of course, as the functional and technical requirements of the digital archives get more complex it may, eventually, become time to upgrade the archival storage and/or (meta)data management component to a comprehensive digital repository system.

However, this decision should be driven by requirements, not by digital repository peer pressure ;-)","Does my Digital Archives need a Digital Repository System?","0",,"publish","open","open",,"does-my-digital-archives-need-a-digital-repository-system",,,"2006-11-27 17:34:01","2006-11-28 01:34:01",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=56","0","post",,"5"

I am working on a considerable upgrade to the underlying object and database model which supports the application. As the application matures and evolves it will be relatively easy to make changes and updates to the application modules and user interfaces. However, it will be difficult to make significant changes to the database model once the application goes into active deployment and people start entering information. Therefore, I better get this right now...

ICA-AtoM must be flexible enough to support a wide variety of potential uses. Firstly, as an archival description package for individual archival institutions as well as a union catalog application that can combine descriptions from multiple repositories (e.g. http://humanrightsarchives.org).

Beyond that, I have high hopes that ICA-AtoM can evolve to become an even more universal information cataloging tool that can be used, for example, to manage personal digital archives (e.g. family photos, home movies, music collections, etc) as well as other reference resources that typically support archival collections (e.g. encyclopedias, dictionaries, bibliographies, reference libraries, web links, etc.).

Therefore, I want to be sure that the ICA-AtoM information model supports the International Council on Archives standards out-of-the-box. At the same time, I want it to be flexible enough to support additional information cataloging and classification needs. I want it to be open, extensible and to anticipate the future wave of semantic information organization and sharing.<!--more-->

<h2>Magic Mystery Tour of Information Architecture</h2>
That's why I've spend some mind-bending hours revisiting a number of information architecture standards, communities and research projects.

I've gone everywhere from <a href=""http://dublincore.org/"">Dublin Core</a> to <a href=""http://microformats.org/"">Microformats</a> to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/"">Semantic Web</a> to <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/print/hierarchical-data-database"">modified pre-order tree traversal</a> to <a href=""http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/"">object relational mapping</a> to <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/"">METS</a> to <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/ead/"">EAD</a> to <a href=""http://nost.gsfc.nasa.gov/isoas/"">OAIS</a> to the <a href=""http://www.sims.monash.edu.au/research/rcrg/research/spirt/deliver/conrelmod.html"">Monash Project</a> to the <a href=""http://www.interpares.org/UBCProject/genesis.htm"">UBC Project</a> to <a href=""http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html"">Topic Maps</a> and back to <a href=""http://www.ica.org/biblio.php?pdocid=1"">ISAD(G)</a> and <a href=""http://www.ica.org/biblio.php?pdocid=144"">ISAAR(CPF)</a>.

The most amusing stop on this magic mystery tour of information architecture was dropping in on the Semantic Web vs. Microformats <a href=""http://evan.prodromou.name/RDFa_vs_microformats"">stand-off</a> and <a href=""http://www.poorbuthappy.com/ease/semantic/"">flame war</a>.

The most useful stop was the Topic Map community and a surprisingly <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnmaj/html/Jour5Intro.asp"">relevant article</a> written by a Microsoft architect.

<h2>Towards a Supa-Dupa Information Model</h2>
Somewhere in the back of my brain a universal information object architecture is slowly solidifying. I have, in fact, been thinking about and working on such a model for quite a number of years, starting 10 years ago with my first job out of archives school at a local software vendor and extending into my current consulting and doctoral research.

I posted a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2005/11/04/logical-architecture-for-archives-access-systems/"">high-level architecture diagram</a> for an archives access system on this blog last year. Now I am getting into the nitty-gritty of the information model that would support such a system.

Some of the guiding principles or goals for this base information model are:
<ol>
	<li>There are five core entities: Objects, Agents, Events, Places and Concepts</li>
<ul>
	<li>By default, Object types include archival materials.</li>
<li>By default, Agent types include archival record creators</li>
<li>By default, Place types include archival repositories</li>
</ul>
<li>The user can define new category types for the five core entities (e.g. adding bibliographic materials or artifacts as a Object types)</li>
         <li>Associations and Topic Occurrences are two, parallel contexts in which core entities relate to each other</li>
<ul><li>Associations are any type of relationships between core entities (e.g. 'is a child of', 'is a type of', 'is the creator of', 'occurred at', 'is storage location for')<ul><li>The user can define any type of association</li></ul></li>
<li>Topic Occurrences are instances when a core entity is used as an access point to describe and identify an Object as an information resource (e.g. Object XYZ is an information resource about Concept XYZ or about Place XYZ or about Agent XYZ).</li></ul>
<li>Objects can be used as Topic Occurrences for other Objects (e.g. A. Pallister's book <i>Magna Carta the Legacy of Liberty</i> is an information resource Object that is about the Magna Carta, another information resource Object.</li>
<li>Core Entities, Associations and Topic Occurrences can be grouped and restricted to specific scopes or contexts (e.g. so that boundaries can be established between specific collections and taxonomies)</li>
	<li>Objects can exist in more than one form (i.e. analogue, digital or multiple copies of both) and in more than one place (e.g. real-world and online)
<ul><li>online digital objects must have addressable URIs</li></ul></li>
	<li>Core entities are represented by metadata profiles</li>
	<li>All information resource Objects can be described using at least Dublin Core metadata elements</li>
	<li>All Core Entities can be described at the logical/descriptive level using more than one metadata profile
	<ul><li>The administrative metadata for the storage and physical management of analogue and digital objects must be generic at the physical level</li></ul></li>

        <li>The data model must be flexible enough to surface data stored in ICA-AtoM as EAD, EAC, Microformats, RDF or topic maps (e.g. as XSLT transformations or through REST APIs)</li>
</ol>

Now my challenge will be to implement these design principle and objectives in a functional and optimal web-based application. This means that the complexity has to be hidden from the user and the application can't slow down to a crawl to process a number of complex relationships or database queries.

This is what I'll be working on over the next few weeks using the <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/"">Symfony</a> framework, its Propel object-relationship mapping layer and the MySQL database engine.

I am sure I'll have to make some compromises and tweaks along the way (keep in mind that this list is simply some research notes generated during my best practice analysis) but hopefully this investment will pay off in the long run to make the ICA-AtoM information model as flexible and powerful as possible.

I am currently in the process of establishing the scope and context for my investigation. This requires that a number of key concepts are defined so that I am using terminology that is internally consistent within the research, to properly identify the nature and characteristics of the entities which are under investigation and to facilitate the communication of research results  to archival professionals as well as laypersons (i.e. users of archives access systems and personal digital archives).

One of the more critical definitions is for the actual objects that are made available via archives access systems. I am referring to these as '<em>archival materials</em>.'  As I explain below, I've chosen to move away from some of the more traditional definitions for <em>records</em> and <em>archives</em> to establish a practical, access-based definition for '<em>archival materials</em>' that better reflects the reality of the types of information objects that are being made available via archives access systems today and into the foreseeable future.<!--more-->

<h2>What are 'Archival Materials'?</h2>
Archival materials are information objects that serve as evidence of past events. They record information about past activities and act as memory aids that allow its users to recall and relive them or to re-communicate information about those events at some point in the future.

The term <em>event</em> is used broadly to mean any type of activity or occurrence that could range from a single transaction (e.g. the purchase of a magazine at a bookstore) to any number of inter-related acts (e.g. all the steps involved in ordering, paying, packaging and shipping magazines to a bookstore). It may include a grand and long event such as a war, an election or an opera performance. It can include structured events such as a purchase invoicing procedure, a driver’s license application or a school exam. It may also include unstructured, isolated acts such as a spontaneous dance move or the unsolicited expression of an abstract idea.

Archival materials are the basis for organizational knowledge, legal evidence, historical research, as well as personal and collective memory. Archival materials can include a spreadsheet illustrating monthly sales, a contract that is introduced in a court proceeding, the correspondence of a famous author, family photograph albums, or an audio recording of a someone’s first violin recital. Other common terms in the English language that are used for archival materials include <em>historical documents</em>, <em>archives</em>, or <em>records</em>. [<a href=""#footnote1"">1</a>]

<h2>Traditional Definitions</h2>
Most academic and professional definitions of <em>records</em> and <em>archives</em> focus primarily on their relationship to business processes or transactions and their subsequent role as evidence of those events. [<a href=""#footnote2"">2</a>]  These definitions typically differentiate between those documents that are strongly bound to business processes and those that are merely considered to be supporting documents, drafts, or incidental information. However, within the scope of this research project, a broader, more inclusive definition is used to account for the wide variety of otherwise non-record materials that end up, quite regularly, in archival collections.

In other words, this research is not concerned with archival appraisal, accessioning policies or enforcing a strict definition for the concept of record. It is concerned instead with providing access to those archival materials that have found their way into archival collections, whether for traditional record-keeping purposes or because archivists, donors or researchers have found the materials to be useful, interesting or otherwise worthy of preserving.

<h2>A Practical Definition</h2>
Archival materials are therefore defined broadly as <em>objects in any form that record information which is preserved for future use as a memory aid</em>. [<a href=""#footnote3"">3</a>]  Where this definition differs from more traditional ones is that the focus is not on the process or transaction that created the information object but rather on the fact that it is intentionally being preserved for some future reference and use. In short, this definition is <em>access-based</em> rather than <em>evidence-based</em>, reflecting Angelika Menne-Haritz’s declaration that “the use of archives is the only reason for their existence.” [<a href=""#footnote4"">4</a>]

[<em>update (25Jan06): I've since added the concept of 'proxy' to this definition. See <a href=""#comment-7224"">comment#1</a> below.</em>]

For this reason, the more generic term <em>materials</em> is used instead of <em>records</em> or <em>archives</em>, thereby intentionally avoiding some of the theoretical baggage that these carry. [<a href=""#footnote5"">5</a>]  Materials, quite simply, are the matter or elements of which things are composed. [<a href=""#footnote6"">6</a>]   In this case, it is the matter or elements of which archival information objects are composed. In turn, <em>archival </em> is used in this definition as an adjective that simply implies storage and preservation for future access. [<a href=""#footnote7"">7</a>]

Under this definition of <em>archival materials</em> the scope of my research may include information objects that do not fit the stricter definition for <em>record</em> or even <em>archives</em>. Again, the main rationale is to have an inclusive, practical definition that recognizes all those materials which, regardless of semantics, are being made available on a daily basis through institutional archives access systems because their users have found a use or interest for them. [<a href=""#footnote8"">8</a>]    As Eric Ketelaar notes:

<blockquote>We have to take into consideration that many of the artefacts that in the public perception are considered to be archives function in societal processes of accountability and evidence, just like records and archives-proper. ‘Archives by birth’ and ‘archives by baptism’ are not opposites...[both] serve to understand the past. [<a href=""#footnote9"">9</a>]  </blockquote>

<h2>What About Information?</h2>
In the end, what I find more interesting than the focus on the concepts of <em>transaction</em>, <em>evidence</em>, or <em>process</em> in traditional definitions for records and archives, is that almost all definitions in archival and records management literature are built upon the term ‘<em>information</em>’ but seldom define it further. [<a href=""#footnote10"">10</a>]    It is usually expected that the author and reader share the same understanding of what is assumed to be a universal concept.

Similarly, the definition for archival materials provided above relies heavily on the concepts of <em>information</em> and <em>information object</em>, therefore, I would like to elaborate on these further...in a follow-up post next week...

<em>[UPDATE (Jan23, 2007): The broad nature of the definition that I have provided above requires some further elaboration that distinguishes archival materials from the entire set of all recorded information (through the criteria of preservation) but still defines it broadly enough that it may include the variety of published materials which are often part of archival collections - I have done this in a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/23/archival-materials-a-practical-definition-continued/"">follow-up post</a> today. Next week I will deal with the much more interesting concept of 'information']</em>

<a name=""footnote1"">[1]</a> Although archival materials deal predominantly with human activity, they can also include information related to natural events, such as video footage of a volcano eruption or a biologist’s field notes detailing the behaviour of a group of animals.

<a name=""footnote3"">[3]</a> Note that the archival materials themselves are not memories but ‘<em>memory aides</em>.’ They are used to recall and relive past experiences or to re-communicate information about past events.

The broad nature of this definition requires some further elaboration to distinguish archival materials from the entire set of all recorded information (through the criteria of preservation) but still defines it broadly enough that it may include the variety of published materials which are often part of archival collections.<!--more-->

<h2>Why Preservation is Relevant</h2>
The intentional preservation of an information object is a key factor in determining whether it can be defined as archival material. Preservation implies that the long-term value of the information object has been recognized and that steps, however minimal, have been taken to maintain and protect the information object. [<a href=""#footnote1"">1</a>] This is typically done by collecting and grouping related information objects together into an archival collection that is stored for safe-keeping in a designated storage container and repository, whether that is a shoebox in the attic or an acid-free box in a climate-controlled vault.

The requirement that archival materials are preserved helps to distinguish them from the majority of other types of information objects which are ever-present in the modern world. For example, a stack of magazines on a coffee table cannot be considered to be archival materials. Even though they have been set aside to be read at some later point, no real effort has been made to preserve (i.e. protect and maintain) them over time. However, if these magazines are sorted into binders or magazine boxes and neatly stacked on a bookshelf, then these could be thought of as archival materials (i.e. “objects in any form that record information which is <em>preserved</em> for future use as a memory aid”).

<h2>Why Publication is Not Relevant</h2>
The example of magazines was intentionally chosen to illustrate a second characteristic of this definition which deviates from traditional distinctions between published or bibliographic materials (such as a magazine) and unpublished materials, records or archives (such as the drafts and notes used to prepare a magazine article). The definition of archival materials provided here is focused primarily on the ability of information to serve as a memory aid and not specifically as authentic evidence of a transaction or business process. It is also not concerned with the number of copies or manifestations of the information which may have been created and distributed. Likewise it is not concerned with determining if the creator of the information intended to keep it private or public.

This establishes archival materials as a broad super-set of information objects which may include both records and bibliographic materials as sub-sets. [<a href=""#footnote2"">2</a>]  Again, the rationale is to provide a practical, inclusive definition that reflects the reality of current archives access systems that provide access, for example, to collections of local newspapers, pamphlets, programmes, brochures, postcards and posters alongside collections of personal papers and business records. [ <em>update (25Jan07): note additional <a href=""#comment-7221"">comment#1</a> below</em>]

This broader definition also reflects the progressive blurring in the digital environment of the distinctions between information objects that are published, printed, or copied and those that are not. Confusion about whether a webpage is a publication or a record is one good example. A particular webpage may very well be both but, under the definition provided here, it is only archival material if it is preserved for future use. [<a href=""#footnote3"">3</a>]

Likewise, the thousands of users that download a digitized copy of the Magna Carta document from the British Library website are aware that they are not handling the original document but they are not really concerned about whether what they are downloading should be called a <em>manuscript</em>, a <em>publication</em>, or a <em>certified copy</em>. [<a href=""#footnote4"">4</a>]  They are, however, quite happy to get access to a memory aid that communicates and commemorates important ideas and events in the history of England and Western democracy.

The current disparity between the respective concepts of <em>archives</em> and <em>publications</em> can probably be traced to the concurrent growth in the modern age of both public administration bureaucracies and the publishing industry that arose after the invention of the printing press. [<a href=""#footnote5"">5</a>]  According to Ernst Posner, the distinction in classical times was less of an issue, with the communication and access to information being the paramount concern. Records from the Greek administrations were routinely transcribed onto stone slabs (steles) and displayed publicly:

<blockquote>To Greeks deviations from the exact wording did not diminish the authenticity of the copied text; a record on imperishable stone was deemed of greater value than the perishable original in the archives; and, in addition, the text on the stele was easier of access, just as the text of the modern published law is easier to use than the original act in the archives. [<a href=""#footnote6"">6</a>]</blockquote>

<h2>Back to Something Practical and Realistic</h2>
Similarly, the definition of archival materials presented here is derived from the viewpoint of access and use rather than authenticity or evidence. [<a href=""#footnote7"">7</a>] This means that the scope of this research project may include information objects that do not fit the stricter definition for ‘record’ and may conflict with traditional distinctions between archives and bibliographic materials. Again, the main rationale is to have a pragmatic definition that recognizes all those materials which, regardless of semantics, are being preserved in archival collections and are made available through archives access systems because their users have found a use or interest for them.  To repeat a statement from Eric Ketelaar that I quoted yesterday:

<blockquote>We have to take into consideration that many of the artefacts that in the public perception are considered to be archives function in societal processes of accountability and evidence, just like records and archives-proper. ‘Archives by birth’ and ‘archives by baptism’ are not opposites...[both] serve to understand the past. [<a href=""#footnote8"">8</a>]</blockquote>

<h2>Let's Move on to 'Information'</h2>
O.K. I had to clear that up. Now I can move on. As I mentioned yesterday, I consider the concept of <em>information</em> to be much more relevant or fundamental to a definition of archival materials than <em>business processes</em>, <em>transactions</em> or <em>evidence</em>.

In turn, Diplomatics may refer to each of these four ‘copies’ as ‘originals’: “There may be more than one original of the same document created either at the same time or at subsequent times. This happens in cases where there are reciprocal obligations (contracts between two or more parties, treaties, conventions)” Duranti, Luciana. <em>Diplomatics: New Uses for an Old Science</em> (Scarecrow, 1998), p.49.

"56","2","2007-01-29 12:08:01","2007-01-29 20:08:01","Last week, I posted an <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/22/archival-materials-a-practical-definition/"">access-based definition</a> for the concept of <em>archival materials</em> to help establish the scope and context of my research into archives access systems.

Like most definitions in the archives and records management literature, it leans heavily on the concept of <em>information</em>. However, this term is seldom defined further. It is usually expected that the author and reader share the same understanding of what is assumed to be a universal concept. Therefore, it is necessary to ask ""what is information?""<!--more-->

A literal, etymological definition of information is <em>to give form</em> to something. In the modern usage of the word this means to give form to a message by moulding it into a shape or pattern that can be communicated. Since information is such a universal concept there are many other valid definitions for information originating from a variety of disciplines that make heavy use of the concept (e.g. physics, genetics, neurology, cybernetics, computer science, economics, communications, knowledge management, media studies, library science, archival science, etc.).

<h2>Measurement vs. Meaning</h2>
Most of the existing definitions for information can be grouped roughly into quantitative and qualitative categories. The qualitative definitions are focused on the criteria which add meaning to the message that is communicated as information. The quantitative definitions originate from physics. They are focused on measuring the quantity of information units or the strength of its transmission. This approach reduces information to a binary set of symbols or signals (not necessarily electronic). The quantity or frequency of the total number of possible messages that these symbols can make are calculated against the backdrop of random or intentional noise in the transmission channel (i.e. the signal to noise ratio). This is the foundation of classical information theory which was first introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948 and continues to be used in the communications industry to invent and improve the transmission of information over copper wires, through the air, through fibre-optic cable, etc..

More recently, quantum physics has introduced the concept of <em>qubits</em>, essentially quantum bits of information, as being the fundamental building block of the knowable world instead of matter, atoms or the quantum field. [<a href=""#footnote1"">1</a>]  Of course, information is all around us, all the time. Indeed, as Marcia Bates notes, “the only thing in the universe that does not contain information is total entropy.” [<a href=""#footnote2"">2</a>]  As human beings we are exposed to a daily barrage of information which are sent to our senses as photons of light, scents, sound waves, vibrations, pressure, flavours, etc.. Our eyes, ears, noses, tongues, and skin send these messages to the brain for filtering, processing and recording as memories of experiences, facts and ideas. [<a href=""#footnote3"">3</a>]

Classical information theory and physics is interested specifically in the symbols and signals of these messages and not their intended or interpreted meaning. This is in contrast to the qualitative definitions of information found in the humanistic information sciences (including archival science) that study the processing and use of information. These are very much concerned with the meaning and understanding of the message that the information communicates.

<h2>Meeting Somewhere in the Middle</h2>
In his recent book, <em>Information: The New Language of Science</em>, the physicist Hans Christian von Baeyer has called for bringing the quantitative and qualitative definitions of information closer together. [<a href=""#footnote4"">4</a>]  Interestingly, it was the visionary archivist Hugh Taylor who anticipated something similar ten years ago when he wrote:

<blockquote>As archivists, we are coming to understand more fully the meaning of documentary relationships in all their richness. If we take the universe and its Creator, or the scientific concept of the ‘Big Bang’ theory as the beginning of cosmic evolution, then cosmogenesis, the creation moment, becomes the ultimate context of all matter as it moves down through the galaxies, nebula, planets, and stars to life in all its forms on our own planet; all creation is connected in various ways in a marvelous spatial balance. Out of the formation of new entities has emerged information resulting in communication and memory. [<a href=""#footnote5"">5</a>]</blockquote>

As an archivist, Taylor starts with documentary context and works his way <em>back</em>, all the way back, in this case, to the ultimate context of cosmogenesis. As a physicist, von Baeyer starts with the atom and works his way <em>up</em>:

<blockquote>All empirical evidence in science is collected through the mediation of the senses. We learn about atoms by peering through scanning tunneling microscopes, by translating their random motion, revealed to the touch as warmth, into thermometer readings, by converting invisible nuclear events into the audible clicks of Geiger counters…[Information] is the strange, compressible stuff that flows out of a tangible object, be it an atom, a DNA molecule, a book or a piano, and, after a complex series of transformations involving the senses, lodges in the conscious brain. Information mediates between the material and the abstract, between the real and the ideal...Knowledge of the world is information; and since information is naturally quantized into bits, the world also appears quantized. If it didn’t we wouldn’t be able to understand it. [<a href=""#footnote6"">6</a>]</blockquote>

Somewhere at the intersection of Taylor and Von Baeyer’s grand statements, the same concept emerges; <em>information is at the core of all human existence and at the core of our personal and collective perception of that reality</em>. We use information to give shape, understanding and meaning to our experiences and it functions to communicate and recall those experiences. In very elemental terms this is why we preserve information and retrieve it using tools such as archives access systems. As Eric Ketelaar notes:

<blockquote>Archiving – all the activities from creation and management to use of records and archives – has always been directed towards transmitting human activity and experience through time and, secondly, through space… Archives are time machines enabling man to carry his thoughts, experiences and achievements through time. [<a href=""#footnote7"">7</a>] </blockquote>

<h2>The Importance of Context and Knowledge</h2>
To be sure, in order for information to be useful as memory aids or, if you will, as a time machine, it must be more than the physicists’ stripped down signals or qubits. The qualitative definitions of information require that the recipient of the signals and patterns is able to decode the message and understand what is being communicated. [<a href=""#footnote8"">8</a>]  This requires that the recipient of the message has adequate contextual and background knowledge to decode the signals, symbols or patterns and then to understand the message that these represent. Without the necessary context and knowledge, the message is simply a string of data. [<a href=""#footnote9"">9</a>] That is why knowledge management experts typically refer to information as “data that makes a difference.” [<a href=""#footnote10"">10</a>]

In order to decode the data in a message, the recipient might require knowledge of a spoken or written language and the sounds or symbols (e.g. alphabet) that it uses. [<a href=""#footnote11"">11</a>]   It could also require specialist knowledge of a specific code and its signals, such as the Morse code used by telegraph operators or the international flag code that is used by sailors. It could require specific technical equipment; such as a radio that converts the high frequency electromagnetic waves sent by radio stations into the low frequency sounds that the human ear can detect.

Once the message is decoded, a certain level of knowledge is required to process, interpret and make sense of it. Only then is the data within the message considered to be information. Prusak and Davenport define knowledge as:

<blockquote>a fluid mix of framed experience, values, contextual information, and expert insight that provides a framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences…It originates and is applied in the mind of knowers. [<a href=""#footnote12"">12</a>]</blockquote>

The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) standard uses the concept of a ‘knowledge base’ to determine if a person or system has the requisite contextual and background information to understand received information. [<a href=""#footnote13"">13</a>]  If a message recipient does not already have the requisite knowledge to understand the information then it needs to be included as part of the communication process (e.g. a codebook, a dictionary, a manual, an explanatory note, etc.). Otherwise, the message will never be more than an insignificant string of data. Of course, one of the primary roles of the archival descriptions that are stored and searched in archives access systems is to provide adequate contextual information (e.g. dates of creation) and background knowledge (e.g. biographical sketch of the creators) so that archival materials can be understood and interpreted.

<h2>Let's Objectify It</h2>
The key characteristic of archival materials is that they preserve information for future use. This means that the message which transmits or communicates the information must be recorded so that at some point in the future it may be retrieved and re-communicated or re-experienced. This requires that the message transmission is captured and converted into an object that can be carried forward through space and time. An <em>information object</em> is an entity that contains the content of a message and has the required structure and context to allow that message to be decoded and understood.

I will explore the concept of information as an object in <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/02/05/information-as-an-object/"">a post next week</a>...

"57","2","2007-02-05 11:47:49","2007-02-05 19:47:49","Last week I wrote a post that looked in more detail at the concept of <em><a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/29/what-is-information-anyway/"">information</a></em> as a way to help define <em><a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/22/archival-materials-a-practical-definition/"">archival materials</a></em>. I am going through this process of definitions and explanations to help establish the scope and context for my PhD research on archives access systems. These software-intensive systems provide online users with contextual information about collections of archival materials, allow them to search and browse for archival materials, learn more about their context of creation, management and use, identify their storage location, and request their retrieval.

The key characteristic of archival materials is that they preserve information for future use. As discussed in the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/29/what-is-information-anyway/"">previous post</a>, information is a set of related signals, symbols or patterns that communicate a message which is received with the requisite contextual knowledge to decode and understand it.

In order for archival materials to preserve information for future use, the message that communicates the information must be <em>recorded</em> so that at some point in the future it may be retrieved and re-communicated or re-experienced. This requires that the message transmission is captured and converted into an <em>object</em> that can be carried forward through space and time. This brings us to the concept of an <em>information object</em>. An information object is an entity that contains the <em>content</em> of a message and has the required <em>structure</em> and <em>context</em> to allow that message to be decoded and understood. <!--more-->

<h2>The Medium is not the Message, it's just the Medium</h2>
To record information requires that the message content is affixed or inscribed onto some physical carrier or medium. These could include cave walls, tree trunks, stone tablets, papyrus scrolls, pulp paper, silver-coated glass, celluloid film, vinyl disk, magnetic tape, aluminum hard disks, etc..

By inscribing a message on a physical medium it is possible to bring its contents forward through space and time. Although McLuhan-ites might disagree, the actual message that is being communicated by the information object is found in its content, not the medium.  [<a href=""#footnote1"">1</a>]  The meaning of the message is decoded and interpreted using the information object's context. The medium, in turn,  is simply one part of the information object's overall structure.

<h2>The Structure of an Information Object</h2>
The message must be ascribed using a pattern and layout that allows it to be decoded at some point in the future. Cave paintings are drawn using forms and shapes (e.g. people and animals) that are intended to be decoded by those who view them. Similarly, written languages combine symbols (e.g. letters) from a given code (e.g. latin alphabet) into a form (e.g. words and sentences) that are intended to be decoded by those who read them. The symbols, forms and shapes that make up the content of a message are arranged into a certain order and layout which, in itself, communicates additional information (whether implicitly or explicitly). This combination of medium, form, layout, encoding and the relationships between them can be referred to as the structure of an information object.

<h2>The Message Has No Meaning without Context</h2>
The context of an information object is the environment and conditions in which message contents are created, transmitted and received. As discussed in the previous post, the receiver of a message requires sufficient information about the context of a message to decode and make sense of its contents. The types of contextual information that may be relevant are virtually limitless and may include information about the message creator, their physical location, nationality, mother tongue, mood, body language, tone of voice, intentions, dreams, desires, etc.. The point is that the relevant context is unique to almost every communication instance. Much of the context is implicit in the environment and conditions of the message transmission and the background knowledge and experience of both the sender and receiver.

Of course contextual information is information in and of itself. It can, therefore, be thought of as meta-information which is usually referred to in practice as metadata. The term metadata originates from the data processing and database management discipline to mean, literally, ‘data about data’ (e.g. a field label name such as ‘city’ to describe a database column that stores the names of cities). [<a href=""#footnote2"">2</a>]

Theo Thomassen has pointed out that a distinction should be made between context, context data and archival metadata.  [<a href=""#footnote3"">3</a>]  However, within archival and information sciences the terms context and metadata are used liberally and often interchangeably to refer to both contextual information and meta-information. Furthermore, the term metadata is often used without further distinction to refer to metadata elements (e.g. ‘name’), metadata values (e.g. ‘Peter Van Garderen’), and metadata profiles (e.g. the complete phonebook entry for Peter Van Garderen which, in addition to my name, includes specific metadata values for the address and phone number elements).

For archival materials, contextual information is a critical characteristic of information objects. Archival materials will be referenced and used at some point in the indefinite future, likely long after the original communication of the message has taken place. Any implicit and explicit information about the context of the information object’s creation, management and use must be preserved. This is to ensure that the meaning and value of the original message survives, as much as possible, into the future.

The contextual information for archival materials is captured in metadata profiles that are usually referred to as <em>archival description</em>. The contextual information describes the relationship of the archival materials to specific people, organizations, events, places, dates, environments, rules, conditions, concepts, ideas and to other information objects. The types of contextual information that is captured and documented can range from information about the archival materials’ social-cultural context, juridical-legal context, provenancial-organizational context, administrative-procedural context, functional-process context, documentary context, or technical context. [<a href=""#footnote4"">4</a>]

<h2>What about Digital Information Objects?</h2>
The level of detail and the types of contextual information that is available for archival materials can vary greatly. However, if the archival materials are in digital format, information about their technological context of creation, management and use is critical to ensure their long-term preservation, access and use.

Next week I will look in more detail at the some of the unique characteristics and issues related to digital information objects.

<a name=""footnote4"">[4]</a> As Theo Thomassen concludes in his analysis of the concept of context in archival science, the “way that context is defined or specified is strongly dependent on the purpose for which one wants to use the concept.” The types of context that are considered relevant can vary depending on whether, for example, it is being used to standardize archival descriptions, to appraise archival materials, or to determine which metadata elements are required to protect the authenticity of electronic records.

"58","2","2007-02-12 09:24:17","2007-02-12 17:24:17","From a theoretical point of view there is no difference between a digital and an analogue information object. As I explained in previous posts about the concept of <em><a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/29/what-is-information-anyway/"">information</a></em> and <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/02/05/information-as-an-object/""><em>information objects</em></a>, both are entities that contains the content of a message and have the required structure and context to allow that message to be decoded and understood.

However, in practice, it is much easier for an analogue information object to carry the content and structure of a message forward in space and time because these are intrinsically linked to the information’s medium. For example, if information is inscribed on a stone table or a sheet of paper then the information’s content and structure will likely survive as long as the actual tablet or sheet of paper survive. [<a href=""#footnote1"">1</a>]

However, digital information objects are much more complicated to preserve and keep accessible over time because their relationship to their storage medium is much more ephemeral. The content and structure of a digital information object is not easily contained within a single physical object like a sheet of paper. Instead, the binary inscriptions of a digital information object are dependent on a complex chain of encodings and electrical components for rendering.<!--more-->

Taking some time to consider the anatomy of digital information objects is important for my research into archives access system because archival materials in digital form are very popular with the users of these systems, due namely to the ease with which they are retrieved, used and shared. Let's use the early drafts of my thesis paper as an example. I am preparing it using the XP version of the Microsoft Word software application which creates files in the <em>.doc</em> file format. Each time I open the <em>archives_access_systems.doc</em> file for further additions and revisions it has to travel and transform itself through a complex maze of hardware, operating system software and application software before it is made legible to my eyes against the light of my computer screen. A host of errors could occur en route which would leave the document illegible and would reduce the information to a meaningless string of electrical charges.

<h2>The Perilous Journey of a Digital Information Object</h2>
At its root, the <em>archives_access_systems.doc</em> file is decomposed into an array of binary digits (1’s and 0’s called bits) which are represented on my laptop computer’s magnetic hard disk as either negative or positive polarity charges. The hard disk consists of several metal or glass platters, each of which is divided into thousands of separate clusters. Different portions of the <em>archives_access_systems.doc</em> file are strewn over hundreds of these clusters. Each bit is read by arms on the hard disk controller which move a polarity-detecting, read/write head across the platters. The hard disk controller relies on the contents of a file allocation table to register the cluster locations of each file and to reassemble it into a linear stream of bits that correspond to the <em>archives_access_systems.doc</em> file. Hard disk driver software is then used to move the bitstream as a string of electrical charges from the platters, through the motherboard circuits, to the input/ouput messaging subsystem and file system driver software. Read errors occur commonly at this stage because the head is extremely sensitive to dust, displacement and magnetic charges. Also errors occur when the file allocation table is corrupted or when there is no compatible driver software for the hard disk or the file system.

If successfully retrieved from the hard disk, the operating system sends the bitstream to the application software which is loaded and running in the random access memory circuits. The application software must recognize the header information that should be present at the beginning of the bitstream so that it can decode and render the string of binary digits using the proper layout and form. It must also be able to detect and convert the character encoding that is used to represent the text content (e.g. ASCII or Unicode UTF-8) into legible symbols. Read errors occur commonly at this stage when the application software does not recognize the header information or character encoding because it was created by another version or type of software and it has not been programmed to recognize that particular file type or encoding scheme.

Finally, the application software sends display commands through the RAM circuits to the operating system software which passes them to display driver software. This driver software sends commands through the motherboard to the graphic display circuit card which then sends electrical signals to the computer monitor that turn specific cells in a grid (pixels) on and off to display text, graphics or other parts of the document. Read errors occur at this stage when the display commands sent by the application software and the display driver software are not compatible with the monitor hardware. [<a href=""#footnote2"">2</a>]

<h2>If a Digital Information Object Falls in the Forest...</h2>
In truth, the<em> archives_access_systems.doc</em> file that eventually reaches my eyes only exists as a Microsoft Word document at the logical level. It is not possible to say with full confidence, for example, that the digital information object exists physically on the hard disk clusters, in the RAM circuits that operate the application software, or in the electrical charges of the computer monitor. <em>Each is integral in giving the information object its structure but none of them are its structure</em>. This anomaly has led Ken Thibodeau to conclude that it is not possible to preserve a digital information object, it is only possible to preserve the ability to reproduce it. [<a href=""#footnote3"">3</a>]  This raises important issues about verifying the authenticity of digital information objects when they are reproduced at some later place and time on some other computing platform. There are, in fact, a myriad of other critical digital preservation issues that affect access to archival materials in digital formats. For example, the contextual information and background knowledge that are necessary to add meaning to the digital information objects are also stored and linked using digital formats and tools. Therefore, the relationship of a digital information object to its context is just as fragile as its relationship to its content and structure.

<h2>Digital Preservation is Not My Problem, Man</h2>
However, the problems and possible solutions to the digital preservation problem are out of the scope of my PhD research on archives access systems. [<a href=""#footnote4"">4</a>]   For those projects that are addressing digital preservation issues [<em>which I do in my <a href=""http://artefactual.com"">day job</a> as a digital archives consultant</em>], the ISO Open Archival Information System (OAIS) standard is typically used as the de-facto best practice to guide the implementation of strategies and systems. [<a href=""#footnote5"">5</a>]  The OAIS divides an archival information system into functional components that address ingest (capture), administration, archival storage, data management, preservation planning, and access. Archives access systems can be characterized as the access sub-systems of OAIS-based archival information systems or as stand-alone systems that interface with the archival storage and data management components of OAIS-based systems. [<a href=""#footnote6"">6</a>]   Therefore, one of the key assumptions in this research, and in the design of archives access systems in general, is that archival materials in digital format have been preserved and are available for retrieval.

<h2>I Have Seen the Future and It Is...Digital</h2>
Of course, archives access systems are not only concerned with archival materials in digital formats. They must be capable of providing access to archival collections in both analogue and digital format. In fact, a very significant majority of archival materials currently preserved in collections around the world are in paper and other analogue formats. However, over the coming decades that ratio will change as more analogue materials are digitized for online access and, in particular, because new information will increasingly be created in digital format. For example, a study conducted at the University of California concluded that 5 exabytes of new information was produced in 2002. [<a href=""#footnote7"">7</a>]  The authors estimate that is equal to all the words ever spoken by human beings up until 2002 or 37,000 times the contents of the Library of Congress’ holdings in 2002 (estimated to contain 136 terabytes of information). [<a href=""#footnote8"">8</a>]  Of particular note was that 92% of the 5 exabytes of information produced in 2002 was in digital format and the total amount of new information grew about 30% per year between 1999 and 2002.

There is no doubt, therefore, that the digital information age has arrived and that it will affect all areas of human endeavour, including how we record and access the information that we use as memory aids and proxies for past events (i.e. <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/22/archival-materials-a-practical-definition/"">archival materials</a>). Without minimizing the difficulty of preserving digital information objects over the long-term, digital technologies offer great promise for improving access to archival materials and their ability to communicate information, knowledge, experience and memory. In less than half a decade, a billion individuals worldwide have learned to become online users, consumers and producers. [<a href=""#footnote9"">9</a>]  On a daily basis they are using the World Wide Web to work, learn and play. They are reading the news, banking, seeking medical information, purchasing consumer goods, meeting new people, playing games, and a host of other activities including historical research. [<a href=""#footnote10"">10</a>]

In fact, there is an incredible demand and interest for online access to archival materials, particularly those that are digital information objects (whether <em>born-digital</em> or <em>digitized</em>). Therefore, I am looking forward to the point in my PhD research when I can get past the literature reviews and writing definitions so that I can begin prototyping some of the new technologies and online practices that can enhance archives access systems...

Access aid is defined as “a software program or document that allow Consumers to locate, analyze, and order Archival Information Packages of interest.” Access software is defined as “a type of software that presents part of or all of the information content of an Information Object in forms understandable to humans or systems.” [International Organization for Standardization. <em>ISO 14721 -- Open Archival Information System – Reference Model</em> (2003), p.1-7.]

"59","2","2007-02-19 10:22:04","2007-02-19 18:22:04","Last week my friend and colleague Ian McAndrew humoured me by reviewing <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/22/archival-materials-a-practical-definition/"">my definition of archival materials</a>. Ian's sharp mind immediately picked up on a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/22/archival-materials-a-practical-definition/#comment-7710""> couple of potential cracks</a> in my definition and examples.

In particular, he pointed out that I needed to make an explicit link between preservation and access and he is absolutely right. I am so entrenched in the viewpoint of archives access systems (i.e. working under the assumption that the archival materials I am talking about are going to be made available by an archives access system) that I neglected to make this explicit in my definition. However, I can correct this error by adding a couple of words to my definition for archival materials:
<blockquote>archival materials are objects in any form that record information which is preserved for future <strong><em>access and</em></strong> use as a memory aid or proxy for a past event
</blockquote>
<!--more-->

I then define <em>access</em> as ""the ability to identify relevant archival materials and locate them for retrieval."" The criteria I will use in the scope of my research to determine whether information objects are in fact being preserved for future access is whether they are being made available by an archives access system (which allows users to 'identify archival materials and locate them for retrieval'). This closes the boundary of my scope fairly neatly and tightly. Quite simply, for the purposes of my research, I am dealing with archival materials if:
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha""><li>I have an object that records information</li>
<li>It can be used at some point in the future as a memory aid or proxy for an event</li>
<li>It is preserved </li>
<li>It is made available for future access via an archives access system</li></ol>

As I discussed previously, I am willing to accept pretty minimal criteria for preservation to allow for the inclusion of archival collections that are not professionally managed (or institutional archival collections that are not preserved very well ;-). However, these collections must be made accessible by some type of archives access system to be included within my definition of archival materials. Therefore, I will also establish fairly minimal criteria (a core list of system requirements) to determine whether something qualifies as an archives access system. One of my objectives is to create a simple prototype that can run on a personal computer and provide an archives access system interface to personal collection of digital archival materials (i.e. something more structured and based on archival principles instead of retrieving the materials via Google Desktop or the Microsoft Windows thumbnail browser).

Admittedly, the criteria to use an archives access system to determine if access is being provided is specific to the scope of my research and may not apply universally. However if, for argument’s sake, this definition were to be applied outside of the scope of my research, other criteria could be used to determine whether information objects are indeed being made available for future access. For example, whether or not the objects are catalogued using archival description. Or whether the archival materials have been physically stored for easy retrieval, for example, photographs neatly organized chronologically in albums and stacked on a bookshelf in the family study instead of a pile of photographs in a shoebox stashed in a dark corner of the attic.","O.K., Let&#8217;s Make Sure &#8216;Access&#8217; is in that Definition.","0",,"publish","open","open",,"ok-lets-make-sure-access-is-in-that-definition",,,"2007-02-19 10:22:04","2007-02-19 18:22:04",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=68","0","post",,"0"

I have compacted and combined each of these definitions into a working glossary that will be part of my system design and requirements documentation for a prototype archives access system.

This glossary replaces some of the definitions that I posted to this blog in late Fall 2005 when I was establishing the conceptual background for the research (see the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/category/terms-definitions/"">Terms and Definitions</a> category in the blog archive).

This is only the first draft of this glossary. There are still a number of other critical concepts that I need to study as part of my research literature review (e.g. <em>archival description</em>, <em>collection</em>, etc.).

That is exactly what I did for the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/10/02/ica-atom-alpha-v01-release/"">ICA-AtoM archival description application </a>that I am developing using the Symfony platform. Now that I am working on the next version of this application I have upgraded to the latest version (0.8.0) of Zend Search. This upgrade adds proximity, grouped and boolean searches as well as term rank boosting to the ICA-AtoM application. At the end of this post I have some tips to add to Dave's tutorial that anyone upgrading from older Zend Search versions should be aware of.

The <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/"">Apache Lucene </a>search engine is probably the most widely adopted open-source search engine. It is, in fact, gaining huge popularity in the digital collections world (as evidenced, for example, by the <a href=""http://code4lib.org/node/139"">Lucene workshop </a>at the recent <em>Code4Lib</em> conference). As Mark Jordan noted in <a href=""http://digitizationblog.interoperating.info/?p=346"">his report </a>on the <em>Access 2006</em> library conference, ""Lucene is emerging as the indexer of choice for a number of open source and commercial products since it provides fast searches, can search across separate indexes, and facilitates faceted browsing.""

The beauty of the Zend_Search_Lucene component is that is intended to be a direct PHP port of the Java-based Apache Lucene search engine. The index files it generates are natively accessible to Java-based Lucene applications as well as handy little Lucene utilities like <a href=""http://www.getopt.org/luke/"">Luke</a>. So we'll be getting all the functionality of a world-class search engine with the power and flexibility of the web-ready, object-oriented PHP5 language.<!--more-->

Zend_Search_Lucene is one of several very useful components found in the <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/"">Zend framework</a>. Given Symfony's flexibility it is very simple to integrate such a component into a Symfony-based application.  By the way, I don't see the Zend Framework as a direct competitor to Symfony (unlike CakePHP, for example). The Zend Framework provides very granular components that can be easily integrated into lightweight PHP applications as well as more structured MVC platforms like Symfony. If you are really motivated  you can use it to assemble your very own MVC platform but why would you when you can use such a well-designed, <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/content/documentation.html"">richly documented </a>and <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/trac/wiki/ApplicationsDevelopedWithSymfony"">proven</a> platform as Symfony.

<h2>Zend_Search_Lucene tips for Symfony application developers</h2>
O.K. fine. I like Symfony, I like Lucene and I like Zend_Search_Lucene for the ICA-AtoM application. Let's move on to the nitty-gritty. If you are looking to use Zend_Lucene_Search in a Symfony application for the first time, I'll post my helper class with some basic instructions further below.

Firstly, though, if you've already used <a href=""http://spindrop.us/2006/08/25/using-zend-search-lucene-in-a-symfony-app/"">Dave Dash's tutorial</a> to integrate an older version of Zend_Lucene_Search, I'll just list the changes to keep in mind when you upgrade:<ol>

<li>Firstly, there was a <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-955"">bug related to deleting documents</a> in the original 0.8 release. This bug was fixed but you have to download one of the post-0.8 <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/download/snapshot"">nightly snapshots</a> to get it. I am using snapshot# 20070306-3762 which is performing fine.</li>

<li>There is no need for the <em>require_once</em> calls. Just drop the Zend Framework library in one of Symfony's class <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/book/trunk/19-Mastering-Symfony-s-Configuration-Files#Extending%20the%20Autoloading%20Feature"">autoloading</a> directories or use Symfony's <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/book/trunk/17-Extending-Symfony#Bridges%20to%20Other%20Framework%20Components"">Zend Framework Bridge</a>. The only files and directory required for Zend_Lucene_Search are:<ol type=""a"">
<li>Zend.php</li>
<li>/Zend/Search/</li>
<li>/Zend/Exception.php</li></ol>
It will safe you about 8MB to get rid of the rest of the Zend Framework component directories if you are not going to use them.</li>

<li>Use the <em>Zend_Search_Lucene::create</em> method to instantiate a new Zend_Search_Lucene object when rebuilding an index or creating a new one. Use the <em>Zend_Search_Lucene::open</em> method to add documents to an existing index. This replaces the use of the 'true' parameter to indicate whether a new index is getting created, e.g.:
<pre><code>$index = Zend_Search_Lucene::create('index_location');</code></pre>
not
<pre><code>$index = new Zend_Search_Lucene('index_location', true); </code></pre></li>

<li>There is no need anymore for the index->commit() call. This is handled automatically by the addDocument() method. Exactly when documents are committed to the index depends on your <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.index-creation.html#zend.search.index-creation.optimization"">index optimization</a> settings. Tweaking the buffer sizes creates trade-offs between the speed of indexing versus the speed of querying. Regardless of your index optimization settings, documents are indexed and available for querying as soon as the addDocument() call is completed.</li>

<li>There is no need anymore for the one mega 'contents' field to act as an aggregate default search field. Zend_Search_Lucene will search through all fields by default now.</li>

<li>It is still not possible to update documents in the index. You have to delete them first then add them anew. This is where you'll hit a major snag if you followed Dave's tutorial like I did. The default Zend_Search_Lucene analyzer (which turns field contents into searchable index terms) now ignores numbers. Therefore, if you try to use the my_symfony_object_id field to pull individual documents out of the index it won't work. There are two possible solutions:<ol type=""a"">

<li>Use the <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.query-api.html"">Query API</a> to turn the Id value into a valid query term:
<pre><code>$term =  new Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_Term($my_symfony_object->getId(), 'my_symfony_object_id');
$query = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Term($term);
$hits = array();
$hits  = $index->find($query); </code></pre></li>

<li>Change the default analyzer to one that treats number as index terms. If you change the default analyzer you need to make this explicit each time you create or update the index and before you submit a query:

<pre style=""overflow: scroll;""><code> Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_<strong>Utf8Num</strong>());</code></pre>
or
<pre style=""overflow: scroll;""><code> Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_<strong>TextNum</strong>());</code></pre>

I am using the Utf8Num analyzer so that I can index Utf8 scripts and get hits on number characters (e.g. dates) in all my fields. This way I can also use the _id field as a term specific query in my application's standard search box (e.g. retrieve a specific object by id). However, the Utf8 analyzer is case-sensitive so you have to use a <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.charset.html#zend.search.charset.default_analyzer"">strtolower() work around</a>, as well as store some extra, unindexed copies of the fields you want to use in your hit display so that they are displayed with proper case sensitivity. In the test I've done so far, Utf8 indexing, querying and display seems to working correctly. I did have problems with one obscure script which, I think, is due to the fact that it is a right-to-left script.</li></ol>
I use both a. and b. together, just in case I want to change the default analyzer at some point.</li>

<li>Using '_id' in index document field names is no longer reserved so you can use it to name the field that holds your application's unique identifier (e.g. my_symfony_object_id). Keep in mind, though, that 'id' is still reserved as a unique identifier within the index and the array that is returned for hits.</li>
</ol>

<h2>My Zend_Search_Lucene helper class</h2>
Here is a copy of the helper class that I created for the ICA-AtoM application. In the example below I've changed the object name from 'archival_material' to 'my_symfony_object' to make it a generic example. I've also reduced and renamed the fields that get added as terms to the document for simplicity.

I call the methods in the mySearchIndex helper from my actions whenever I create, update or delete a 'my_symfony_object':
<pre><code>mySearchIndex::updateIndexDocument($my_symfony_object->getId());</code></pre>
or
<pre><code>mySearchIndex::deleteIndexDocument($my_symfony_object->getId());</code></pre>

Of course, these could also be refactored down to the model classes but the timing of my index delete/update calls varies depending on a number of factors (namely whether or how many-to-many relationships are added/deleted) so I need to keep these helper calls in my actions for now.

<pre><code>< ?php

     {
      $this->getResponse()->setTitle('Search for \'' . $this->query . '\'', true);
      }

    $search_index = SearchIndex::getIndexLocation();

    $hits = array();

    if ($this->query)

Restrictions: none, released into public domain' align='right' style='margin: 5px;' />Well that was a waste of time. I tracked down and bought a song that I had heard several times recently (on my favourite Internet radio station <a href=""http://somafm.com/recent/?indiepop"">SomaFM</a>) only to have it locked up by draconian DRM technology. There is no way that I am introducing this digital mutation into my personal digital archive. I am totally convinced that, thanks to Digital 'Restrictions' Management encryption, this track will be useless  five years down the road when I am using a whole new platform of PCs and MP3 players.

I am an avid music fan. My music collection is just as valuable to me as my family photograph collection. It has very much the same function. Music is a constant backdrop to my daily life. Certain songs or genres define whole periods of my personal history. They can evoke detailed memories of experiences, emotions, people and places from my past. They scroll by like a grainy home movie in my head as the song plays. I use the music in my collection to enhance or change my moods and to create soundtracks to brand new experiences that will form my future memories. Therefore, I am determined to preserve and protect my music collection like any other collection of archival materials.<!--more-->

<h2>Foiled by DRM</h2>
So why did I buy the DRM track in the first place? (a) Impulse: I really, really had to have it, right now, and it wasn't available for purchase on any non-DRM websites (b) DRM trickery:  the icons placed next to track indicated that I could copy it unlimited times and transfer it to three different MP3 players. What it didn't clarify (except for some fine print tucked away on another page) was that all the playback, copying and transferring functionality was limited to the actual machine which I used for the download, which happened to be my office laptop.

By default, the file transfered automatically from my office laptop to my home PC using <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/01/13/a-new-backup-routine-for-my-personal-digital-archives/"">my synchronization and backup setup</a>. On my home PC is where I like to relax and organize my music collection like a good obsessive-compulsive archivist. I was really p!ssed off, therefore, when I sat down later that evening to listen to my must-have track and transfer it to my MP3 player for the morning workout, only to find out that the 'license' wasn't applicable to that machine and I couldn't do squat with it.

I should have know better. For a moment the music fan in me got the better of the digital archivist. The basics of DRM (hardware-dependence, encryption, proprietary formats) goes against all the digital preservation basic practices. First of all, your digital collection needs to exist independent of the media and hardware which is required to store and use the content because they will be obsolete or incompatible in a few years. On top of that, the laptop itself is leased from Dell and will be shipped back to them in a couple of years, along with my 'unlimited copying' ability. Turns out I hadn't bought the song. I hadn't even leased it like my laptop. I had contracted it to perform certain specific services, in specific locations, in a limited number of predetermined ways. When did being a music fan get to be so complicated?

<h2>Digital Rights Go Both Ways</h2>
To be sure, I fully support the artist's right to get reimbursed for their work and creativity. That's why I wasn't trolling the P2P world for an 'unauthorized' copy in the first place. I am more than happy to pay $0.99 for a track that I can download and enjoy instantly on my computer or MP3 player. When I am interested in a band or song, I'll visit their website or MySpace page to check out some more of their songs. If I like 3 or 4 of the tracks, I'll buy the album. If I don't, I just want to buy the track, preferably straight from the band, their label, or a non-DRM service such as eMusic.com.

However, once I've bought the track I expect to own it as a piece of property, just like when I buy a book or physical CD. Instead, DRM technology actually violates standard Western property laws. Imagine a dealer selling you a car and then refusing to give you the keys. Of course, I don't own the copyright on the track but I expect to have fair use of it to allow me to create backup copies for preservation purposes, to transfer the files to any playback device of my choosing and to burn mix CDs to share with friends. I personally don't consider sharing over a P2P network to be fair use because I don't know any of the people that I am 'sharing' with and, of course, selling bootleg copies of CDs is and should be illegal.

<h2>Preservation Format</h2>
As well as being free of restrictions enforced by encryption, when I add a music file to my personal digital archives I want it in a format that is suitable for long-term preservation. As of today, that happens to be MP3, not Apple iTunes' proprietary AAC or Microsoft's proprietary WMA format. MP3 is technically not an open-standard because there a number of patent challenges against it but, like PDF for documents, it is the de-facto archival standard for music files because of its ubuquity and its registration as an ISO standard. Technically speaking both Open Document Format and Ogg Vorbis are more open than PDF and MP3 respectively but this is where there is a trade-off between the purity of an 'open' standard and the ubiquity of tools, support and fellow users. When MP3 is no longer the best option for long-term preservation, there will be plenty of migration tools and bridge technologies because of the format's widespread use. More importantly, I can't play Ogg Vorbis files on my MP3 Player.

<h2>Common Sense at the Library and Archives of Canada?</h2>
Because of the problems with hardware-dependence, encryption and proprietary formats, institutional digital archives typically refuse to accession digital objects that have any DRM technology associated with them. The Library and Archives of Canada has recently enacted rules that require publishers to remove all DRM encryption for published digital files that they submit, as required by law, for legal deposit at LAC. This is just standard digital preservation common sense. If security is a concern, it needs to be applied at the repository level not the item level. There is no way that an archives can efficiently manage, in perpetuity, all the encryption keys that accompany each individual file.

If the LAC has enacted such a common-sense rule to protect the nation's digital information, why should my personal digital archives be managed to any lesser standards? The song I purchased has entered my mindspace. It is part of how I experienced March 2007 and how I choose to remember it. I need it in my music collection. I need it to be there when I want to enjoy the song again and to relive March 2007 as part of the constant dialog between past and present that my music collection facilitates. However, as a WMA file with DRM it is effectively locked up using a combination of elliptic curve cryptography key exchange, the DES block cipher, the RC4 stream cipher, and the SHA-1 hashing function. Good luck preserving access to that.

<h2>Options</h2>
So what options do I have? I can pay $15.99 for a CD which will take a couple of weeks to arrive and from which I only want one track. I can step into the P2P back-alleys and see if someone in the network is willing to 'share' the song with me. By the way, in Canada that' s currently legal. When I bought my MP3 player I paid a levy to cover that (like the one on blank cassettes and CDs). I can also download a hacker tool that is able to open the encrypted file I purchased and then save an unencrypted copy of it. I don't think that is legal though. Definitely not in the U.S. thanks to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

<h2>The End of DRM?</h2>
At least the distribution channels are waking up to the poor logic of alienating law-abiding consumers like me. Both <a href=""http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=c4fe4fe1-bd7c-489b-bfdf-54991a0587be"">iTunes and Puretracks </a>are trying to convince the big 5 music labels that it is in everyone's best interest to drop DRM. However, music publishers and their goons at the RIAA are so freaked out by the democratization of music that they'd rather <a href=""http://www.agoravox.com/article.php3?id_article=5751"">sue 10 years </a>old to bully the music-loving public into submission.","Man, I Hate DRM","0",,"publish","open","open",,"man-i-hate-drm",,,"2007-04-02 10:08:18","2007-04-02 18:08:18",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=71","0","post",,"8"

While in The Netherlands I had the opportunity to meet with representatives at the Nationaal Archief to discuss their work with EAD and, in particular, their virtual reference room project (which is managed by Yvette Hoitink who blogs over at <a href=""http://nederlandserfgoed.blogspot.com/index.html"">Nederlands Erfgoed</a>).  I also dropped in at the City of Rotterdam Archives to check on the progress of their digital reference desk <a href=""http://www.gemeentearchief.rotterdam.nl/digitalebalie/"">prototype</a> and I met with my PhD supervisor, <a href=""http://cf.hum.uva.nl/bai/home/eketelaar/cve.html"">Dr. Eric Ketelaar</a> to review the progress of my doctoral research (and got a great impromptu tour of the historical heart of the University of Amsterdam which dates back to 1632).

My primary liaison in the Netherlands is Peter Horsman, research coordinator at the Dutch Archiefschool, associate supervisor on my PhD research, and for all intents and purposes, the project director of the ICA-AtoM project. Peter and I reviewed the progress of the ICA-AtoM software development and I gave a demonstration of alpha version 0.2 of the ICA-AtoM application to his Archiefschool colleagues. Most significantly, Peter and I caught the train to Paris last Wednesday to meet the next morning with the ICA Secretrary-General and Program Managers to discuss the objectives and roadmap for the ICA-AtoM Project.<!--more-->

<h2>What is ICA-AtoM?</h2>
ICA-AtoM is an open source archival description application. The name is an acronym for â€˜International Council on Archives â€“ Access to Memory.â€™  The initial catalyst for the development of the ICA-AtoM software was the ICA project on Archives and Human Rights Violations: International Guide to Sources. The purpose of this Guide is to make it easy for individuals and organizations, which may not be professional archival institutions, to contribute to an online database of archival materials related to human rights violations. The Guide then enables researchers worldwide to identify archival materials relating to a particular human rights topic, locate the country and repository in which the archival materials are held, and determine the conditions for access to these documents. Data-entry testing for the Guide will begin in June.

The UNESCO Information For All Programme provided the funding to develop the software for the Guide website. This software became the first alpha version of the ICA-AtoM software that can now be used for the description of any kind of archival collection according to ICA standards. The software was developed by myself, through my firm Artefactual Systems, under the direction of Peter Horsman at the Dutch Archiefschool.

<h2>The Collaboration</h2>
<a href=""http://ica.org"">The International Council on Archives</a> is interested in a providing an open-source archival description application to the international archival community, in particular to assist with the automation of under-funded archival institutions and to allow them to make their collections available online. The ICA-AtoM software will also help to promote the standards and programs of the ICA.

<a href=""http://www.archiefschool.nl"">The Dutch Archiefschool</a> is interested in the development of an ICA-sanctioned, open-source, archival description application to use for the instruction of students in its archival description courses. The Archiefschool is also interested in applying and extending ICA-AtoM as prototyping software in a variety of its research projects.

My company <a href=""http://artefactual.com"">Artefactual Systems</a> is dedicated to the development and promotion of open-source technologies within the archival community. As well, I am researching archives access systems as a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam. I will use and extend ICA-AtoM to develop prototypes related to my research.

<h2>ICA-AtoM Key Features</h2>
Over the past year, two other open-source archives software applications have cropped up (<a href=""http://www.archiviststoolkit.org/"">Archivist's Toolkit </a> and <a href=""http://www.archon.org/"">Archon</a>). As well, there have been a number of <a href=""http://www.ica.org/biblio.php?pdocid=18"">commercial archives software applications</a> available for two decades now (albeit a relatively small number compared to other cultural sectors).

Therefore, one of the important discussions I had with the Archiefschool and ICA last week was to clarify what ICA-AtoM's niche and identity should be in relation to other archives software packages. I was glad to hear that the other collaborators agreed that it would be difficult and foolish to try and make ICA-AtoM all things to all people in its early stages. It is better to do one thing well, rather than to do many things poorly. Therefore, the primary focus of ICA-AtoM will be standards-based archival description and web-based access.

The key features of the ICA-AtoM application are rooted in the Guide to Human Rights Violations project, namely, making it easy for organizations with limited techical capacity to make their archival collections available online, to allow for the creation of multi-repository databases in multiple languages, and to provide a tool that implements ICA standards. To facilitate remote administration and access and to ease deployment, the application must be fully web-based. Lastly, the application must be free and open-source to leverage the development effort (i.e. pay for development once, install and enhance indefinitely) and to encourage an international community of shared practices and tools around archival automation.

<img src='/wp-content/images/ICAAtomModules.jpg' alt='' />

Despite the early focus on archival description and access, the ICA-AtoM application is built on an open, modular architecture (using the <a href=""http://symfonyproject.com"">Symfony MVC platform</a>) that is designed to support easy integration and plugins of new modules and application features in the future.

<h2>Software Release Roadmap</h2>
The other topic of discussion was the best way to release the application and software code. One option is to release the alpha code early and often and hope for the best. This is an approach that can be successful in more technical communities of practice. However, I don't think anyone will argue that the archival profession is a highly technical community (at least not yet, the next generation will have to be).

Instead, it was decided to continue internal development of the software codebase and conduct testing within a limited group of early implementers. The Archiefschool will sponsor this next phase of software development. The ICA-AtoM project will then  use the ICA Congress of July 2008 as its official launch event.

That gives us about a year for more intenstive development and testing to make ICA-AtoM a solid archival description and access application, leading to a preliminary public release of a stable beta version in early 2008. This will allow for enough lead time to develop rich documentation, tutorials and training workshops to support the official launch at the ICA Congress. This conference will also provide a good opportunity to take stock of the ICA-AtoM software and talk about its long-term governance and direction.","European Travels and the ICA-AtoM Roadmap","0",,"publish","open","open",,"european-travels-and-the-ica-atom-roadmap",,,"2007-04-25 06:35:50","2007-04-25 14:35:50",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=72","0","post",,"0"

I have been following Christian Van Der Ven's <a href=""http://digitalearchivaris.blogspot.com/"">blog posts </a>with some interest so I already had some idea of what to expect and what to look for. Christian (who is <em>Christi Janus</em> in-world) has been exploring and musing what opportunities Second Life might have for archives and archivists. If you've never heard of Second Life, check out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b72CvvMuD6Q"">this introduction video</a> on YouTube.

The first order of business was to get an account, choose an in-world name, download the client software and complete the mandatory (but brief) tutorials before being let loose into the Second Life world. Then I spent a good two hours altering my appearance (body, hair, clothes, etc.). So here then is <em>Maximum Vollmar</em>, my Second Life alter-ego.

Then I teleported over to InfoIsland and Cybrary City where a number of archives, libraries and their staff have begun to claim the information science professionals' place in Second Life. They have a virtual reference desk staffed in shifts by real-world reference desk personnel from around the world. However, it appears their main role is to help newcomers to Second Life and not really to provide reference access to real-world collections.<!--more-->

<h2>Chatting and Flying -- the fun part</h2>
Nevertheless, I ran into some very nice people to chat with at the InfoIsland reference desk. The immediacy of connecting with other people in a virtual space is real and fun. I actually found Christian there right away and I joined the <a href=""http://groups.google.ca/group/archivists-of-second-life?hl=en""><em>Archivists of Second Life</em></a> group.

I then took some time to levitate and fly around the island. Even though it is virtual reality, the effect of flying and virtual weightlessness is still pretty cool. I like it. Here I am floating above the future Library and Archives of Canada building in SL.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/AboveLAC.jpg' alt='floating above future LAC site' />

<h2>Crashing and Finding Your Way -- the not-so-fun part</h2>
However, I think that virtual chatting and flying are probably the highlights for me. My first impression is that there are still very few library or archival collections or interfaces to collections in Second Life. There are some impressive looking buildings and public spaces that are fun to walk through and explore but they typically offer a dis-organized, hodge-podge of content, most of which are URL links back out to the 'real' Web.

Also, Second Life is extremely disorienting to navigate. It is hard to get a grasp on what is available where, even when limiting your movements to a couple of islands. Part of the problem is that Second Life only renders your immediate surroundings so there is a feature-less horizon all around you where, in fact, there are buildings and places you just left. As well, the Second Life technical environment appears to be significantly unstable right now, partly the by-product of large volumes of newcomers like myself. The serious Second Lifers have, in fact, just voiced <a href=""http://www.projectopenletter.com/"">their serious concerns</a> about it. I was frozen out several times and had to completely re-boot my machine.

<h2>The Second Life potential</h2>
Okay, but fair enough. It is still early days in this brave new world. Kind of like the World Wide Web in 1995. I do think Second Life has lots of potential to enhance the access experience for some targeted user groups (i.e. youth and tech-savy adults with lost of time on their hands). In particular if we can use real-world databases as back-ends to SL interfaces, which may become more common with the advent of tools such as <a href=""http://www.slquery.com/"">SLQuery</a> or the use of the SL scripting language <a href=""http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Category:LSL_HTTP"">HTTP Request functionality</a>. At the same time, I don't think SL will ever become the mainstream channel for people to access online content, i.e. a lot still has to happen if Second Life clients are ever going to become as commonplace on desktops as web browsers.

The challenge will be to use the virtual world to enhance the archival access function and experience, otherwise it just becomes a time-sucking toy and a poor substitute for standard web interfaces. My initial gut feeling is, in fact, that SL environments will never replace web-based archives access systems but that their main role is going to be in networking, hosting events, and building communities around archival collections and historical topics of interests...and for flying through virtual stacks :-)","Second Life, First Impressions","0",,"publish","open","open",,"second-life-first-impressions",,,"2007-05-01 16:22:56","2007-05-02 00:22:56",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=73","0","post",,"1"

I'll follow-up about the logical data object model in a later post.

First of all, for the uninitiated, ICA-AtoM is a open-source, archival description application that is <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/04/25/european-travels-and-the-ica-atom-roadmap#more-72"">currently in development</a>. It is being built using the MySQL database engine, PHP5 object-oriented programming language and the <a href=""http://www.symfony-project.com/book/trunk/01-Introducing-Symfony"">Symfony</a> web-application framework. Symfony incorporates a number of web development best practices and design patterns into a single framework making it easier to develop, maintain and contribute to applications that implement this common framework structure.<!--more-->

<h2>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern</h2>
At its highest-level, a Symfony application such as ICA-AtoM follows the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller"">Model-View-Controller </a>(MVC) design pattern.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/MVCarchitecture.jpg' alt='' style=""float:clear; text-align:center;""/>

Views are the templates or webpages that the users see and interact with. The controllers consist of a front controller and related action code to route, filter and process the user input and to trigger application logic.  The model layer reads and writes content to the database and converts it into programmable objects that are processed by the controller layer to carry out the application functionality and to pass on for display in the view layer.

The <em>model</em>, <em>view</em> and <em>controller</em> are conceptual layers which consist of actual .php files that are stored on a webserver and organized into a standardized directory structure or 'scaffolding'. The data  that is used by the application is stored in a database server that is accessible from the webserver. Users interact with the application by posting request and receiving responses via their web-browser software. The entire physical architecture (webbrowser, webserver, php5 files, database server) can be distributed over multiple clients and servers or it can be run on a single, stand-alone PC.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/fullMVCarchitecture.jpg' width=""604"" height=""557"" alt='' />

The model-view-controller design pattern is a web-based version of the classic <em>n</em>-tier architecture that seperates business logic, data persistence and presentation resulting in improved maintability and scalability.  The Symfony framework provides the tools, interfaces and design rules to make the model, view and controller layers work together. Symfony is fully open-source (MIT license) and fully-configurable.

Any part of the framework can be enhanced or by-passed but, of course, there is tremendous value in sticking to the framework rules such as: development efficiency through the re-use of existing components, shared documentation, bug fixes, new feature plugins, readability of code for other developers, implementing best practices. These are some of the main reasons why Symfony was chosen as the development platform for ICA-AtoM, rather than simply building an application from scratch.

<h2>The View Layer</h2>
The Symfony view layer implements the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern"">Decorator</a> design pattern which progressively adds layers of user interface output starting with a site-wide layout template. This global template is populated with the context specific templates and slots which are generated in response to the actions triggered by the user (i.e. clicking a link, pressing a button, moving the mouse). The templates are populated with data retrieved via the model layer.The resulting view is styled and themed using Cascading Style Sheets. Here is part of the view template that is generated by the 'show' action for the 'archival_material' object.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/Template.jpg' alt='' />

<h2>The Controller Layer</h2>
All web requests made to a Symfony application are handled by a single front controller (i.e. http://myWebsite/index.php) which routes the request and associated parameters to the appropriate action code. The controller layer also handles the user session, security and filtering output response. The core of the controller layer is the action code which is organized into modules that represent the core functions (e.g. search, browse)  and data objects (e.g. archival material, repository) that are managed by the application. As show in the directory below, the modules that are implemented in ICA-AtoM vo.2 include actor, archival material, browse, menu, repository, search, staticpage, term and user.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/ApplicationScaffolding.jpg' alt='' />

<h2>The Model Layer</h2>
Like other MVC frameworks (such as RubyOnRails and Django), Symfony contains an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Relational_Mapping"">Object-Relational-Mapping</a> (ORM) component to help store and load the programmable objects that are used by the application to the tables and rows in a relational database (which is by far still the predominant way to persist data in software applications). Propel is the default ORM tool that is packaged with Symfony. It has a database connection interface that filters the generic SQL queries made in the Symfony application to work in a number of specific database engines.

MySQL is used as the default database engine in ICA-AtoM development because it is the most ubiquitous open-source database application, making it easier to deploy and support. However, using the Propel database connection, ICA-AtoM data can also be stored in MS-SQLServer, Oracle, Postgress, SQLite, or ODBC-compliant databases.

Propel uses the <a href=""http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.asp?p=30661&rl=1"">Row/Table Gateway </a>design pattern to map the application objects to tables and rows in the database. This means that each class in the logical application model maps one-to-one to a table in the physical database model and each object, or instantiation of a class, maps to a row or record in the table.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/database.jpg' width=""652"" height=""457"" alt='' />

In other words, the physical data model (shown in the MySQL table list above) is almost identical to the logical object model used at the controller layer. For example, I have an ArchivalMaterial table in my database that uses ISAD(G) fields as the fields or columns. Each row in this table gets loaded into the ICA-AtoM application as an ArchivalMaterial object which now has ISAD(G) fields as its active attributes and can take on behaviours through class methods such as exportToEadXML() or addToSearchIndex().

In a follow-up post, I'll take a closer look at the logical object model that is implemented in ICA-AtoM.","ICA-AtoM Physical Architecture","0",,"publish","open","open",,"ica-atom-physical-architecture",,,"2007-05-28 09:53:03","2007-05-28 17:53:03",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=74","0","post",,"1"

One of the main objectives is to link archival materials related to specific buildings (e.g. deeds, property tax rolls, city directories) to markers on a dynamic map, such as GoogleMaps. This provides a whole new access method (i.e. map-based browsing) that is lots of fun and very direct. This feature will now be provided out-of-the-box with the first public release of the open-source ICA-AtoM code (scheduled for early 2008).<!--more-->

<h2>The Inspiration</h2>
I had been meaning to do this for a while but felt inspired yet again when I took a look at Yvette Hoitink's <a href=""http://www.sintannatermuiden.nl/index.php/Hoofdpagina"">Sint Anna ter Muiden</a> website. This site uses MediaWiki software and a GoogleMap mashup to build an online history of the medieval Dutch town of Sint Anna ter Muiden. Yvette's day job is project manager for the Dutch National Archives' <a href=""http://api.ning.com/files/0Y-ff0YNVj8d9N4kYKaYWsN7TMaDheusrkObFMs*XWI=/5209507.pdf"">Virtual Reading Room</a> project. I met her in The Hague a few months ago to discuss their innovative project. I crossed paths with her again, and found out about her Sint Anna ter Muiden website, at the <a href=""http://archief20.ning.com/"">Archief2.0 online community</a> where Dutch Archivists are discussing web 2.0 technology.

I had originally planned to just copy Yvette's MediaWiki setup to test GoogleMaps mashup features but decided I might as well go the extra mile and maximize the time spent by integrating this functionality directly into the ICA-AtoM application. I did most of the work on the plane ride to and from the Association of Canadian Archivists conference in Kingston, Ontario a couple of weeks ago, as well as during conference sessions. Oddly enough I found it easier to listen to speakers while working on something very structured on my laptop. I think my mind wanders too easily if I am forced to focus on just one thing for too long. Two things in parallel seems to keep me focussed on both, which is why I have to listen to music while I work. But I digress, more about the maps...

<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
As discussed in my <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/05/28/ica-atom-physical-architecture/"">previous post</a>, ICA-AtoM is built using the Symfony PHP5 platform. I integrated the open-source <a href=""http://www.phpinsider.com/php/code/GoogleMapAPI/"">PHP GoogleMapAPI</a> component which was fairly easy to do, given Symfony's auto-loading and templating features. I only had to hack it in one place to replace its native geocode caching features with an interface to my application's Propel object model component. This feature will take a street address and send it to the Google or Yahoo! geocode lookup service to match it with the appropriate latitude and longitude. Those are then used to place a marker on the map.  The geocodes are then saved in an application cache so that it doesn't have to perform a lookup each time the map is loaded.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/ICAAtoMGoogleMapAPIPlaceExtension_01.jpg' width='584' height='477' />

I redirected the geocode cache to a Place object which I added to the ICA-AtoM data model. In a <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/12/08/the-information-model-to-end-all-information-models/"">previous analysis </a>I had recognized Place as a core entity in a generic information cataloging system that, like Event, is significant enough to be managed as a separate entity, rather than just another term type in a subject thesauri.

This Place object will allow users to manage metadata about geographical places and link them in contextual hierarchies that provide for multi-level inheritance much like multi-level archival description (e.g. Sapperton (neighbourhood) -> New Westminster (city) -> Lower Mainland (region) -> British Columbia (province) -> Canada (country)). These Places can be linked to other core objects in the ICA-AtoM application (e.g. Archival Materials, Authority Files, Repositories, Terms) to provide rich relationship contexts as well as standard place name access points for text-based searching and browsing.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/ICAAtoMPlaceObject.jpg' width='650' height='629' />

Of course, the new and interesting feature is then to link those Place objects to thematic maps. In the case of an Authority File you can create a Map object for all the place names found in a person's biographical sketch. You can create online walking tours or, in the SappertonHistory.ca example that I've posted, a historical site register. It really is up to the user because I've added a Map object to the ICA-AtoM application that allows an administrator to create any number of custom maps to link to Place objects. These links appear as map marker icons on the map and provide a hyperlink to the Place object metadata profile. The map marker icons can be supplemented with thumbnail pictures and additional descriptions.

<h2>Map Mash-ups are so 2006</h2>
Of course, GoogleMaps mash-ups are nothing new and this is not really very ground-breaking, but I am excited to finally get a chance to test out a pretty fundamental Web 2.0 feature in one of my own projects. Zooming in to a recent satellite photo of a location that I pass by often, while superimposing a historical photo of that same location over the map, creates a really immediate effect. For example, look how the driveway of the Woodlands Hospital photograph, taken early in the last century, matches to the driveway on the very current satellite photo. You can almost imagine yourself standing there a hundred years ago.

However, this month turned out to be a good time to do one last major update to the model, so I've got to put that arcane write-up on hold until the update is complete.

In the meanwhile, I've been mulling over the potential of three new technologies that are being discussed out there in the InterWeb blogosphere. All three have the potential to dramatically change the way we access information. Now I know you hear that kind of hyperbole almost everyday in the Web 2.0, beta site, dog-and-pony show circuit but, trust me, each of these is different.<!--more-->

<h2>Photosynth</h2>
First off, is this video demo of Seadragon technology that provides high-resolution zooming and scrolling navigation controls to access large image collections. That's impressive to begin with but then <a href=""http://labs.live.com/photosynth/"">Photosynth</a> technology combines Seadragon with three-dimensional imaging for some very cool results. In this demo, images of the Notre Dame cathedral are scraped from Flickr and imposed onto a navigable, three-dimensional object. Check this out:

<h2>Freebase</h2>
<a href=""http://freebase.com""><img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/freebase.png' width='424' height='281' align='right' style='margin: 5px;'  /></a> Behind the second door is <a href=""http://freebase.com/"">Freebase</a>.  Freebase is a practical realization of the long-hailed potential of Topic Maps and the Semantic Web. One way to describe this project is a data-aware Wikipedia.

Freebase is an open-content database of user-contributed information that is made machine-accessible by explicitly identifying the attributes of each topic and allowing them to be connected dynamically and semantically to other attributes to create new topics, topic types and topic domains. It differs from traditional information stores because data values are not tied to a single object, database table or Wikipedia article, for example.

In database geekspeak, the Freebase data is normalized to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain/key_normal_form"">domain/key normal form (DKNF)</a>, the holy grail of information modeling. Through a public API, Freebase content is opened up to external applications and has the potential to become the clearinghouse of publicly-shared knowledge. As one blogger noted, it also has the potential to achieve consciousness and kill us all, but that is at least another couple of years away.

The best way to get your head around it is to watch their short and easy-to-understand <a href=""http://freebase.com/view/tutorial/"">demo video</a>. However, it only appears to be available on the password-protected part of their website. Therefore, if you haven't signed-up for a <a href=""http://freebase.com/signin/register"">Freebase invitation</a>, you'll have to take <a href=""http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/freebase_will_p_1.html"">Tim O'Reilly's Freebase write-up</a> as the next best thing.

<h2>Surface, aka 'Microsoft's big-ass table'</h2>
I am little bit skeptical about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface"">Surface</a> being another Microsoft ploy to lock us all into their proprietary world.  However, this proximity-aware, data-exchange, touch-screen interface has potential if it is made available to all devices via truly open standards. Admittedly, this is probably the less promising of the three technologies I list here and this video helps to bring us all back down to earth from the hype balloon ride.

"69","2","2007-09-11 15:19:50","2007-09-11 23:19:50","I've been a little quiet on the blogging front for the past month but that's because there's lots going on lately and its been tough to find a couple of hours to write a post. I'll just break the blogging silence then with a quick update post about what's been going on:
<ol>
 <li><strong>I reproduced</strong>. My wife Amanda and I had our second son, Tobiah, born August 12. Big brother Mattheus is already 3 years old and started his second 'semester' of preschool this morning.</li>

        <li><strong>I proposed</strong>. An Association of Canadian Archivists 2008 conference session on 'Open Source Software for Archives'. Hopefully the program committee will be interested. Even more exciting though, is a proposal that I submitted to organize an 'ArchivesGeekFest' immediately before the ACA 2008 conference. This will be an event in the tradition of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp"">Barcamp unconferences</a> and the Access Library Technology Conference <a href=""http://www.access2006.uottawa.ca/?page_id=13"">Hackfest</a>. The idea has received lots of good feedback so far, so hopefully this will fly. It should be lots of fun.

  <li><strong>I expanded</strong>. Yes, my waistline grew but so did the <a href=""http://ica-atom.org"">ICA-AtoM </a>project team. I've hired two additional staff to assist with documentation, testing, coding and upgrading our development infrastructure.</li>

 <li><strong>I collaborated</strong>. One of the more important developments for the ICA-AtoM project this summer is a collaboration with a related open-source project that has a similar vision and functional requirements. We began with some informal discussions and comparing notes. We are now moving to a stage where we are going to co-develop some of our underlying code in order to leverage our respective knowledge and skills. This will save time and money as well expand the implementation base and support community for each project when we are ready to put our applications into live production. This is all still in its early stages but I will be able to reveal more as this collaboration matures over the coming months.</li>

 <li><strong>I modeled</strong>. Not fashion but data, which is fashionable if you are a geek. I have upgraded the ICA-AtoM data model to take it one step closer to  <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2006/12/08/the-information-model-to-end-all-information-models/"">my ideal information model</a> which I posted about last year. I used the ideas and principles from that investigation to arrive at the data object model that is now implemented at the core of the ICA-AtoM application. I will elaborate in detail on this model in future posts but here is a sneak peak at the <a href=""http://ica-atom.org/docs/images/ICA-AtoM_0.4_ClassDiagram-rev4.gif"">data model diagram</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>I coded</strong>. The data model is a significant refactor. This is like lifting up your house and pouring a new foundation. I'm making sure now that all the walls, pipes and vents line up properly before putting the house back down. By the end of this month I hope to have completed this intensive but rewarding exercise. Then its on to adding internationalization, XML import/export, spicing up the interface with AJAX controls and getting some test sites running so that others can finally kick the tires on the application.</li>

 <li><strong>I didn't do any research</strong>. My PhD research topic is more relevant than ever and I know exactly what I need to do and write. If I could only get about six months free from all other commitments I could have 90% of it done but I know that is a fantasy. I am going to have to try to set aside a month in early 2008 to at least get the second chapter done (analyzing archival description or 'representation' and its role in archives access systems).</li>

 <li><strong>I didn't blog</strong>. Didn't have the time. I feel slightly guilty about this, especially when other bloggers out there like Jeanne at <a href=""http://spellboundblog.com/"">SpellboundBlog</a> or Jill at <a href=""http://hurstassociates.blogspot.com/"">Digitization101</a> are consistently posting thought-provoking, meaty articles. From what I've read, they're busy people too but they still find the time to post great articles about digital trends and events in the information science world. I remember reading an article about 'blog guilt' which is anxiety about not posting regularly. I read about it in a traditional print newspaper so it must be a legitimate disorder. I think I have that.</li>","What&#8217;s Happening&#8230;","0",,"publish","open","open",,"whats-happening",,,"2007-09-11 15:19:50","2007-09-11 23:19:50",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=78","0","post",,"4"
"70","2","2007-10-13 11:07:34","2007-10-13 19:07:34","Today is the last day of the <a href=""http://access2007.uvic.ca/"">Access Library Technology Conference</a> conference here in sunny Victoria, BC.. Archives have usually been the poor cousins to Libraries when it comes to deploying IT and, based on what I've seen and heard over the past few days, that's still the case. Therefore, this conference is a great opportunity to hear about where Archives IT will likely be in the next couple of years.

The predominant, underlying theme of the sessions here has been the dissatisfaction of libraries with their traditional OPAC access systems and ILS vendors. This has led to a growing interest in adding Web 2.0 layers on top of those platforms and supporting open-source solutions as a legitimate alternative to commercial products (namely <a href=""http://www.open-ils.org/"">Evergreen</a> and <a href=""http://www.koha.org/"">Koha</a>).<!--more-->

Of particular interest to the many locals in the audience was the <a href=""http://pines.bclibrary.ca/"">recent decision</a> of the Association of BC Public Libraries to deploy and support the open-source Evergreen ILS throughout their network. According to their rough estimates, this will give them a costs savings of about $15 million dollars in vendor license and support fees over the next few years. That is savings left-over after subtracting the total cost of ownership for deploying, hosting and supporting Evergreen.

From a technical point of view, I heard a lot about faceted search. In particular how this can be provided by <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/solr/"">Solr</a>, the web-services wrapper for the Lucene search engine. I also met a lot of the people involved in the Aloutte Canada project and learned more about the high-level vision, the back-end technical architecture of the Aloutte portal, and the grassroots user requirements. This was very useful to me as the ICA-AtoM project is <a href=""http://www.qubit-toolkit.org/"">now collaborating </a>with the Aloutte Metadata Toolkit on the underlying platform to build our respective applications (which share about 95% of the same functional and user requirements).

<h2>myHackfest at Access2007</h2>
All in all, therefore, the Access2007 conference turned out to be a productive use of my time. The highlight, however, was the <a href=""http://access2007.uvic.ca/?page_id=8"">Hackfest</a> held on the first day. On Wednesday I took the early Harbour Air flight from downtown Vancouver just in time to land in Victoria Harbour at 8am and catch the shuttle bus, loaded with 40 fellow geeks, leaving the conference hotel for the University of Victoria where Hackfest was being held.

Hackfest is a one day event prior to the Access conference where small groups of library geeks team up to work on a specific IT problem. The actual projects are nominated online prior to the conference and only revealed to the Hackfest participants on the day of the event. This year there were about 24 nominated projects. The participants self-organized themselves into project teams which ended up addressing about 10 project proposals. After reading through the short, one-sentence descriptions, I put my name down under the ""<a href=""http://triton.library.uvic.ca/hackfest/view.php?item=29#(1)"">Evergreen in One Day</a>"" session and ""<a href=""http://triton.library.uvic.ca/hackfest/view.php?item=15#(1)"">Face the Facebook Facts</a>"" but ended up working on the <a href=""http://triton.library.uvic.ca/hackfest/view.php?item=18#(1)"">GoogleMaps Canadian Library Locations
</a> project.

The idea behind the project was fairly straight-forward. Take a database of Canadian Inter-Library Loan locations and put them on a GoogleMap so that a user looking for a book that is not available at their local library can easily locate the nearest library that does have it on an interactive map that links to the library websites. Two years ago this would have been cutting-edge. In October 2007 this is something that is already pretty pedestrian. Nevertheless, map-based browsing is something useful to work on that I can apply to my ICA-AtoM work. We ended up using the <a href=""http://www.phpinsider.com/php/code/GoogleMapAPI/"">PHP GoogleMapAPI</a> which I had already used previously in an <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/07/05/ica-atom-now-with-googlemaps-mashup/"">ICA-AtoM prototype</a>.

We spent a significant part of the day on the import of ILL data (which one team member had brought as an Excel spreadsheet), server setup, API integration and the MySQL connection to the PHP script. We <a href=""http://www.archivemati.ca/ill-googlemap/"">got it working</a> by the end of the day but unfortunately did not have enough time to address the user interface. A follow-up to this Hackfest project would be to add user-interface controls to filter and search on other criteria like name, city, province, library type, etc. and to determine a usability strategy for adding 100+ hits on a map. Nevertheless, the constraints of a one-day project was a fun challenge and it was a pleasure to work collaboratively with a small team on the problem. We posted our results as a filtered display of the 169 results that are returned when searching on 'University Library' as an ILL library type. I then did a quick 5 minute presentation of the results to the rest of the conference during one of the designated half-hours for Hackfest updates. Lots of fun. Hopefully I will have time to participate in Hackfest and Access2008 next year.","Access2007 Conference and my first Hackfest experience","0",,"publish","open","open",,"access2007-conference-and-my-first-hackfest-experience",,,"2007-10-13 11:07:34","2007-10-13 19:07:34",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=79","0","post",,"1"

In this second piece he once again drives home the point that digital information is different because it has less constraints than its paper counterpart. It is not shackled by physical constraints like shelves, storage cabinets, card catalogues and microfilm readers. Instead, it is out there, out of the reach of 'experts' (e.g. librarians and archivists), ready to be tagged and linked by the masses.

I am not sure I agree fully with his implied conclusions. As I learned during several discussion about faceted search at the recent <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/10/13/access2007-conference-and-my-first-hackfest-experience/"">Access2007 conference</a>, bad metadata is bad metadata. There is still an argument to be made for quality (e.g. precision) vs. quantity (e.g. recall). I also don't think that information in digital form changes <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/01/29/what-is-information-anyway/"">the fundamental definition of information</a>, although it does change how that information is organized and used.

At any rate, this is another very watchable video that somehow manages, once again, to evoke the wonder, emotion and intellectual excitement that is the attraction to most of us working their way through this digital information r/evolution.

However, I am still a getting a lot of hits daily on past articles and i've decided to just do what I can, when I can. Perhaps it will become a quarterly issue ;-)

I put together a little business plan slide presentation and was going to call it 'archivematica'.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/archivematicaconcept_02.gif' alt='' />

Well, the project fell by the wayside, as per usual, when I got too busy with paid contract work. However, as you can see from the name and URL of this blog, the domain name still came in handy.

Even if I would have had time to pursue this concept further at the time, I would have run into <a href=""http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/16-01/ff_scraping"">a number issues</a> with trying to 'scrape' profiles and content from websites such as Flickr, MySpace, Facebook, etc.. It turns out the new 'open' web still has many <a href=""http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/03/ive-been-kicked-off-of-facebook/"">closed doors</a>.

That's why I'm very excited to hear about the work of the <a href=""http://dataportability.org"">DataPortability.org</a> group.

<img src='http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/images/DataPortability.gif' alt='' />

They share the same objectives as my 'archivematica' concept, namely:
<ol>
  <li>""We want sovereignty over the profiles, relationships, content and media we create and maintain.</li>

 <li>We want open formats, protocols and policies for identity discovery, data import, export and sync.</li>

 <li>We want to protect user rights and privacy...""</li></ol>

DataPortability.org is not interested in inventing new protocols or standards. Instead they want to create a <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/dataportability-public/web/reference-design"">Technical Interoperability Blueprint</a> to define how existing, simple-to-implement, de-facto protocols and standards (e.g. OpenID, RSS, Microformats, etc.) can be integrated and aligned to make user data portable between multiple online sites and services. Of course, this will require buy-in from the big Web 2.0 sites, so 'evangelism' is a major component of the DataPortability.org work.

I am very excited about this initiative. I have joined the discussion groups and will be tracking progress with interest. Hopefully I'll have an opportunity in the near future to implement the DataPortability.org reference designs in the tools that I am now working on.","DataPortability.org - an important step forward for personal digital archives","0",,"publish","open","open",,"dataportabilityorg-an-important-step-forward-for-personal-digital-archives",,,"2008-01-29 12:49:25","2008-01-29 20:49:25",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=83","0","post",,"3"

"78","2","2008-04-18 03:46:19","2008-04-18 07:46:19","Archivematica was hacked by some spammers a couple of weeks ago which was made possible by the fact that I was running an ancient, insecure version of Wordpress. I put up a 'sorry, site not available' page since I did not have the time to migrate to a later version of Wordpress. I was actually considering it an opportunity to quietly back-out of my blogging presence as I have hit the blogging wall several times over the past year. 

Well, to my pleasant surprise, I started receiving emails almost immediately from people wanting archived copies of old posts. In particular my <a href=""/papers-presentations/"">presentation</a> screencasts. Several requests were of the panicky variety as people were using them for classroom instruction and had assigned them as readings or were about to go into a meeting where they planned to refer to them. Who knew!?

To say the least, I was flattered and decided it was worth the effort to re-instate the blog. Of course, it would also be sadly ironic if I were to let a blog about digital archives disappear, save the <a href=""http://www.google.ca/search?q=+site:archivemati.ca"">cached copies over at Google</a> and the <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://archivemati.ca"">Internet Archive</a>. 

So here is Archivematica 2.0 with a fresh theme and another cautious promise to actually fill it with content now and then. For anyone that was concerned about accessing old posts and contents, everything should be available via any of the old or temporary links that I've assigned over the years. Now I'm off to review my blog backup process...","Archivematica...back from the dead","0",,"publish","open","open",,"archivematicaback-from-the-dead",,,"2008-04-18 03:46:19","2008-04-18 07:46:19",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=78","0","post",,"1"

"80","2","2008-04-26 11:12:20","2008-04-26 15:12:20","I was in Victoria, BC yesterday to give a demonstration and presentation on the <a href=""http://ica-atom.org"">ICA-AtoM</a> software project at the Archives Association of British Columbia (AABC) conference. It was also the first opportunity to announce the <a href=""http://aabc.bc.ca/aabc/bcaul.html"">BCAUL</a> pilot project that <a href=""http://artefactual.com"">Artefactual Systems</a> will carry out in partnership with the AABC, Library and Archives of Canada, Simon Fraser University Archives and University of Victoria Archives. The software and migration project were well received.  Archivists are excited about the prospect of an open-source alternative to manage their descriptions and put their collections online.

The BCAUL pilot project will implement an <a href=""http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000"">ISAD</a>-to-<a href=""http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/archdesrules.html"">RAD</a> crosswalk, test migration of data from the current BCAUL database, remote data-entry directly into the BCAUL database via the ICA-AtoM web forms (UVic Archives), EAD XML import of archival descriptions from an alternate system into the BCAUL database (SFU Archives), and development of an archival description harvesting features (sponsored by the Library and Archives of Canada).

<a href=""http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ica-atom-network-diagram.png""><img style=""vertical-align: middle;"" src=""http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ica-atom-network-diagram.png"" alt="""" width=""502"" height=""405"" /> </a>

If everything goes well during the pilot phase, we will make a full migration of the BCAUL data into an ICA-AtoM hosted system. Other key components of the project include an assessment of the technical readiness of British Columbia archival institutions to use one of the three options to contribute their archival descriptions to the new BCAUL and the preparation of training material and support services (via the AABC's existing <a href=""http://aabc.bc.ca/aabc/advisor.html"">Advisory Service</a>). Of course, the upgraded network will have to work with whatever tools individual institutions choose to manage their archival descriptions but for those that currently don't have archival description software or are having trouble getting their existing descriptions online they can implement the free and open-source ICA-AtoM software.

In the meanwhile, development of the ICA-AtoM software continues at a blistering pace. I demonstrated the 0.6 development version at the conference yesterday. We would have liked to package this version into a release a few months ago already but we're slowed down by the data model refactoring that is necessary to implement a fully internationalized application as well as actually translating the user interfaces and default content (from English into French, Spanish, Portugese, and Dutch). Nevertheless, additional development of new features such as XML import/export and the application installer continues in parallel to the internationalization work.

The official launch of the 1.0 beta will take place at the <a href=""http://www.kualalumpur2008.ica.org/"">ICA Congress</a> in Kuala Lumpur in late July. This will ship with an installer and a demo environment. However, if you are a developer or techie familiar with the <a href=""http://subversion.tigris.org/"">Subversion</a> source code versioning system and setting up a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29"">LAMP</a> environment then you are welcome to <a href=""http://ica-atom.org/code.html"">checkout the software</a> from the online repository at any time.","ICA-AtoM Goes Provincial","0",,"publish","open","open",,"ica-atom-goes-provincial",,,"2008-04-26 11:12:20","2008-04-26 15:12:20",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=80","0","post",,"2"

We found a willing partner in the ICA and off we went. It's been a race to the ICA Congress in Kuala Lumpur ever since. We will launch our first beta 1.0 release there in July. When we drafted our initial project plan I had hoped to have a more polished, mature application ready for the ICA Congress but we have come reasonably far given the short time span, limited resources and very ambitious design which we are working with. Earlier this month we reached another important milestone when we held the first meeting of the <a href=""http://ica-atom.org"">ICA-AtoM</a> Steering Committee in Amsterdam. Besides good software, documentation and an active user community, the other critical success factor for any open-source project is to clearly establish its purpose, licensing and governance structure. This is namely to assure potential users that thought and planning has gone into the long-term sustainability of the software. After the Steering Committee meeting in Amsterdam I think the ICA-AtoM project is well on its way to accomplishing this. See my <a href=""http://www.ica.org/groups/en/node/63"" target=""_self"">discussion list post</a> for more information about the ICA-AtoM mission statement and governance structure.","The ICA-AtoM Project is growing up","0",,"publish","open","open",,"the-ica-atom-project-is-growing-up",,,"2008-05-28 19:51:51","2008-05-28 23:51:51",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=84","0","post",,"2"

However, I am most excited about the <a href=""http://barcamp.org/ArchivesGeekFest"">ArchivesGeekFest</a> which I helped to organize. I am happy to be proven wrong but I suspect that this may be the first ever BarCamp for archivists, or maybe the second if you count the <a href=""http://www.bpexchange.org/"">Best Practices Exchange</a> Conference (which seems like a great unconventional conference for information professionals that I've been tempted to attend but always too busy to schedule).

I was inspired to propose and organize ArchivesGeekFest after attending several BarCamp style events here in Vancouver, which has a great tech community, as well as the <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/2007/10/13/access2007-conference-and-my-first-hackfest-experience/"">Access conference Hackfest</a> in Victoria this past fall.

We've only got 16 registrants but my hope is that we'll have enough fun and share enough ideas with this small group to inspire this to become a regular feature of the ACA conference (i.e. the 'unconference before the conference'). In the end, BarCamps are about participation so its going to be up to all 16 of us to make something of it. If it doesn't fly at least I've tried and I'll always have the next <a href=""http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver"">Vancouver DemoCamp</a> to look forward to.","ArchivesGeekFest: the world's first BarCamp for archivists?","0",,"publish","open","open",,"archivesgeekfest-the-worlds-first-barcamp-for-archivists",,"

I am in Goiânia, Brazil right now, attending the Association of Brazilian Archivists conference. Yesterday, I delivered a 3 hour presentation on the ICA-AtoM Project and Open Source Software for Archives. They seem to like long presentations with lively debate running into over-time here in Brazil. Fortunately, there was a translation service available, although the animated debates sounded much more interesting in their native Portugese. I have posted my presentation slides <a href=""http://archivemati.ca/papers-presentations"">here</a>

I did the entire software demonstration and presentation using the Ubuntu Linux LiveCD which we have customized to load a demo version of ICA-AtoM. We are currently duplicating these CDs for distribution to all the registrants at the ICA Congress in Kuala Lumpur where we are officially launching the Beta 1.0 release of the software. The LiveCD includes a free copy of the OpenOffice.org suite which I used for my presentation slideshow. You are free to burn your own copy of the DemoCD which is available for download <a href=""http://ica-atom.org/democd/"">here</a>.

The Brazilian Archivists are very interested in the ICA-AtoM. This is due in large part to the fact that the entire Brazilian public sector is rapidly <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4602325.stm"">switching over to open-source</a> solutions. Since ICA-AtoM is translated into Portugese, it now gives Brazilian archival institutions an opportunity to join in this movement.

Ricardo has been doing the Portugese translations for the ICA-AtoM project. He will be installing ICA-AtoM at the Bahia State Archives shortly so that they can begin beta testing the software.","ICA-AtoM Goes to Brazil","0",,"publish","open","open",,"ica-atom-goes-to-brazil",,,"2008-07-05 14:29:39","2008-07-05 18:29:39",,"0","http://archivemati.ca/?p=87","0","post",,"5"

The response has been overwhelmingly positive. We had great attendance at our launch presentation, user workshops, adminstrator workshop and steering committee meeting. I was asked to give a briefing on the project last night to the ICA Executive Board and I was interviewed about the project by the ICA Flying Reporters, who did an excellent job covering all the happenings of the ICA Congress. Here is a <a href=""http://www.kualalumpur2008.ica.org/en/reporters/news/inside-scoop-ica-atom-access-memory"">link to the interview</a>.

<img align=""right"" src=""http://archivemati.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ubuntu_lab.jpg"" style=""padding: 5px;""/> We distributed over 1300 copies of the ICA-AtoM beta 1.0 Demo CD. These are customized Ubuntu Linux LiveCDs that are running Apache web server, MySQL database server, Mozilla Firefox and the ICA-AtoM application. The CDs load the Linux operating system and application stack into the memory of any type of computer. This makes it easy to demo our web application on a local machine. This picture shows our Demo CDs bypassing Windows in the computer lab to prepare for the ICA-AtoM user workshop.

We now have over 30 archival institutions worldwide signed up to join the formal round of beta testing which will take place between October 2008 and March 2009. We also have volunteers to translate the application into another five languages. We are in discussion to test deployment with several institutions and it appears likely that we have sponsors for some focused development work on the application core which will help to move it forward from an early beta version to a stable production-ready release.

If you weren't able to attend the ICA Congress you can download and burn your own copy of the Demo CD or simply try out the online demo version of ICA-AtoM available at <a href=""http://ica-atom.org/demo/"">http://ica-atom.org/demo/</a>. Of course, if you have your own web server or web hosting account you can <a href=""http://ica-atom.org/download.html"">download</a> and install your own copy of ICA-AtoM. 

Please keep in mind, however, that this is an early 1.0 beta version. It is undergoing active development and testing. We'd love to get your feedback on the <a href=""http://groups.google.ca/group/ica-atom-users"">user discussion list</a> to report any bugs and to help us improve the software to meet your requirements.
